## Description

This notebook gives a general introduction into the attention-based neural network architecture proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017, commonly referred to as the Transformer. First, an overview of previous architectures is presented. Then the individual components of the Transformer are described in detail. Finally, a Transformer network is implemented from scratch using tensorflow and trained on a small dataset to translate from German to English.
