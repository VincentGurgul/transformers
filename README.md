## Introduction

This repository contains resources on python libraries for keyword extraction, text generartion and machine translation that are based on transformer networks. 

## How to run the code

__First:__ Decide if you want to run the notebook in Jupyter or in Colab

### A. Jupyter

__Step 1:__ Download this repository to your machine

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VincentGurgul/transformers.git
```

__Step 2:__ Install requirements for the notebook your want to run, e.g. Machine Translation

```
$ cd 4_Machine_Translation
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Step 3:__ Launch jupyter lab or jupyter notebook

```
$ jupyter lab Machine_Translation.ipynb
```

### B. Colab

__Step 1:__ Download this repository to your machine

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VincentGurgul/transformers.git
```

_… or as .zip file in the top right corner of the GitHub web application_

__Step 2:__ Open Google Drive and upload the repository

__Step 3:__ Double click on your desired notebook to open Colab
