IMF's Christine Lagarde put under investigation in French fraud case - source,http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-imf-s-christine-lagarde-put-under-investigation-in-french-fraud-case-source-2014085,"IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been placed under formal investigation by French magistrates on Wednesday for her alleged role in a long-running political fraud case, a source close to the former French finance minister said.

The source said Lagarde, who earlier was questioned by magistrates in Paris under her existing status as a witness, considered their decision to investigate her for alleged ""negligence"" was unfounded and would appeal it. A French judiciary source also confirmed the step.

In French law, magistrates place someone under formal investigation when they believe there are indications of wrongdoing, but that does not always lead to a trial.

The inquiry into tycoon Bernard Tapie has embroiled several of former president Nicolas Sarkozy's cabinet members including Lagarde.

Tapie - who supported Sarkozy in the last two elections -was awarded 403 million euros in a 2008 arbitration payment under Sarkozy's presidency to settle a dispute with the now defunct, state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais over a 1993 share sale. Lagarde was finance minister at the time.

Activision's Hearthstone Could Be the Next Candy Crush Saga,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/05/05/activisions-hearthstone-could-be-the-next-candy-cr.aspx,"Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is one of the most addictive video games I have ever played, and certainly, the best I have ever played on a tablet. I am not alone in thinking this -- the game, released April 16 for the iPad, currently has a 93 (out of 100) on Metacritic, an aggregator of video game reviews, and ranks among the top 20 free apps on the iTunes chart.

With Heartstone, Activision is set to successfully cash in on two of the biggest trends in video gaming: mobile and free to play -- trends that newcomers, including King Digital (NYSE:KING.DL), have sprung up to take advantage of. If there was any doubt that Activision would be beholden to traditional platforms and methods of distribution, Hearthstone should put those concerns to rest.

Activision finally goes mobile

In the simplest terms, Hearthstone is a digitalized card game: Two players, connected over the Internet, compete against each other using a series of cards played strategically. Matches tend to last 10 minutes or less, and while the rules are simple, the game offers a deep degree of strategy.

Hearthstone is free to download, and completely free to play, but the cards available to players are initially limited. Better, more diverse cards are unlocked over time, but can also be purchased using real money. Right now, the game is only available for the iPad and Windows PCs, but is expected to make its debut on the iPhone and Android devices later this year.

Hearthstone, then, is a unique game for Activision. Of all the major video game publishers, Activision has been the most reluctant to embrace new forms of gaming: It likes its $60 annual Call of Duty releases, and subscription-based World of Warcraft.

Activision's CEO, Bobby Kotick has even at times downplayed and to a degree disparaged mobile gaming. But with Hearthstone, Activision could be sitting on the next mobile gaming hit.

Free-to-play mobile games are swamping everything else

Mobile gaming is growing far faster than the broader industry. According to App Annie, spending on mobile games grew more than 200% in 2012, and on Android, grew more than 400% in the fourth quarter alone.

In the U.S., spending on mobile games totalled $1.78 billion in 2013, according to eMarketer, and research firm Gartner expects mobile games on a global basis to bring in $22 billion in 2015. Much (perhaps most) of that money will go to the creators of free-to-play games.

App Annie notes that in both March and April, the top-grossing app companies -- Supercell, King Digital and GungHo Online -- specialized in free-to-play games like Clash of Clans, Candy Crush Saga, and Farm Heroes Saga. Like Hearthstone, these games generate revenue through the use of optional, in-app purchases.

Hearthstone is a huge opportunity

Right now, the market values King Digital at roughly $5.5 billion -- a bit less than 40% of Activision's market cap. Many have argued that King Digital is grossly overvalued, and perhaps it is, but if Hearthstone could achieve Candy Crush-like success, Activision could reap a tremendous windfall.

Candy Crush generates nearly 80% of King Digital's revenue. Investors are obviously betting on King Digital's ability to create future games that perform as well or better financially, but based purely on its revenue, Candy Crush Saga alone appears to be worth several billion dollars.

Assuming that Hearthstone continues to grow in popularity, Activision investors could get that -- along with Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and the company's other upcoming PC and console titles.

Rather than focusing strictly on the latest Call of Duty announcement, Activision investors will now have to keep an eye on the app charts.",0,614,Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ:ATVI) Hearthstone:," Heroes of Warcraft is one of the most addictive video games I have ever played, and certainly, the best I have ever played on a tablet.

But there’s still much work to be done before we see any significant improvements over last year.

About half of those enrolled had insurance coverage prior either way; about one-third would've gotten private plans under Medicaid without subsidies anyway. Those numbers also showed continued improvement even though most states saw no change between January 2012 until now.

ECB's Draghi Says Recovery Proceeding; Hints At June Action,http://www.rttnews.com/story.aspx\?Id=2318148,"European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that the moderate recovery in the euro area is proceeding as expected and hinted that policymakers would decide on further action after seeing the June macroeconomic projections.

""Recent information remains consistent with our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by only a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates,"" he said during the post-decision press conference in Brussels.

""The signals from the monetary analysis confirm the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term.""

Earlier today, the Governing Council decided to maintain the main refinancing rate unchanged at a record low 0.25 percent, for the sixth month in a row.

The ongoing moderate recovery in the Eurozone continued in the first quarter of 2014 as well as in the beginning of the second quarter, the central banker noted.

Reiterating the forward guidance, Draghi said the ECB will monitor economic developments and money very closely. ""We will maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation and act swiftly, if required, with further monetary policy easing,"" he said.

""The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation.""

Responding to questions from reporters, Draghi said,""The Governing Council is comfortable with acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early June."" The euro weakened after the comment, falling below $1.39.

Asserting the central bank's independence, Draghi said calls for ECB action from think-tanks and politicians risks undermining the central bank's credibility.

This week, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development urged the ECB to reduce rates, given the falling inflation and the risk of deflation.

Risks to the euro area economic outlook remains on the downside, Draghi said. ""Geopolitical risks, as well as developments in global financial markets and emerging market economies, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively,"" he cautioned.

Meanwhile, risks to the inflation outlook are broadly balanced, he added. The possible repercussions of both geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments will be monitored closely, he said.

Draghi also called the strengthening euro ""a cause for serious concern"". That said, the exchange rate is not a policy target, he maintained.

Asian shares start week with drop,http://www.cityindex.co.uk/market-analysis/financial-news/asian-stock-markets-news/25703232014/asian-shares-start-week-with-drop/,"Disappointing economic data released by both China and Japan has contributed to a fall in Asian stock markets during trading today (March 10th).

The new week has got off to a bad start as a result of the figures, which led to Japan revising down its 2013 growth estimates. China also revealed in a new set of economic data that its exports have dropped by 18.1 per cent, in a move that surprised analysts.

This led to drops for all the major Asian indexes over the course of the session, with the Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and the Shanghai Composite each down by more than 1.6 per cent. The Nikkei, the main stock market in Japan, was also down for the day and ended the session over one per cent down, reports BBC News. The Nikkei had hit a five-week high last week.

Economic targets

China's finance minister Lou Jiwei stated that it would be acceptable if the country slightly missed its targets for economic growth. The nation is aiming to grow its economy by 7.5 per cent this year to ease fears from investors of a slowdown in the country's growth.

""Whether GDP growth is to the left or to the right of 7.5 per cent, that is not very important,"" said Mr Lou, according to a report by international news agency Reuters.

Also included in the newly released economic data for China was that the country reported a slowdown in inflation, with a drop to two per cent in February from 2.5 per cent in January shown in the figures. This was noted by the Asian nation to be the slowest rate in 13 months.

Japan has reported its largest deficit since 1985 and the country also revised its 2013 economic growth from one per cent to 0.7 per cent, indicating that the nation is yet to put the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster behind it.

The clear-up operation at Fukushima is ongoing and the Japanese government has had to pay large sums to make the site safe in the wake of the nuclear accident.

BMO says fixed interest rates may be the better deal amid possible rate hike,http://www.cp24.com/news/bmo-says-fixed-interest-rates-may-be-the-better-deal-amid-possible-rate-hike-1.1727032,"

The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Longer-term fixed mortgage rates may soon be a better deal than variable rates for homebuyers, according to a new report by BMO Capital Markets.

BMO (TSX:BMO) chief economist Douglas Porter and senior economist Benjamin Reitzes say that historically, choosing a variable mortgage rate has been more ""cost-effective"" than locking in on a five-year fixed rate, but this may no longer be the case as signs of an improving economy continue.

It's been long anticipated that both the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to hike interest rates in 2015.

""True, it may have seemed that markets and economists have played the role of The Little Boy Who Cried Wolf on higher interest rates in recent years,"" says the report released Thursday, titled ""Mortgage Choices: The Fix(ed) is In.""

""But there are emerging signs that the tide is finally turning for rates, especially with the U.S. economy poised to accelerate. The bond market has sent out loud warning signals over the past year that the era of low interest rates may finally be drawing to a close.""

Currently, a five-year fixed mortgage rate from one of the big Canadian banks hovers above three per cent, with variable rates ranging below that.

Porter and Reitzes say that as bond yields rise they will put pressure on borrowing costs and long-term mortgages.

""So, even if variable rates take some time to climb, we may not see such low fixed rates again any time soon,"" says the report.

They also said any potential hikes will affect most those who are already stretched too thinly in the housing market, so locking in at a higher rate may be beneficial for this group to weather any drastic increases.

""For those who don't have much financial flexibility and would run into difficulty from a pronounced upswing in interest rates (typically first-time homebuyers), any potential extra cost for peace of mind now appears to be a price well worth paying,"" according to the report.

Earlier this week, the Teranet-National Bank national composite price index found that home prices are steadily rising.

In February, Canada home prices rose 0.3 per cent.

The index, which tracks the average home price in 11 metropolitan markets, found that home prices were up in all five markets surveyed in Western Canada and were down in all five metropolitan eastern markets except Montreal.",0,398,The Canadian Press TORONTO," -- Longer-term fixed mortgage rates may soon be a better deal than variable rates for homebuyers, according to a new report by BMO Capital Markets.

Five Bernard Madoff ex-workers convicted of conspiracy,http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/five-bernard-madoff-ex-workers-convicted-of-conspiracy-1.7487846,"Five former aides to Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff were convicted on all counts of conspiracy and fraud Monday, a clean sweep for the government in the first criminal trial stemming from the $20 billion scam.

After taking just four days to convict on all 31 counts after a 5-month trial in Manhattan federal court, jurors said afterward that they just didn't buy the claims of the longtime Madoff workers that he fooled them into thinking everything was legal.

""I didn't believe them,"" said juror Craig Parise, of Westchester County. ""I don't believe you can work somewhere for 40 years earning the amount of money they did without knowing what's going on.""

""I think they might not have known how big it was, but they were involved,"" said Nancy Goldberg, a juror from Yorktown Heights. ""The number of years -- decades and decades. If I worked there, I'd get suspicious.""

Relying on a half-dozen Madoff ex-workers who pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate, prosecutors accused former account managers Annette Bongiorno, 66, of Manhasset, and JoAnn Crupi, 53, of Westfield, N.J., of putting fake trades on account statements.

Former operations manager Dan Bonventre, 67, of Manhattan, and computer programmers Jerome O'Hara, 51, of Malverne, and George Perez, 48, of East Brunswick, N.J., were charged with helping churn out phony statements and reports to fool customers, auditors and regulators.

All five were convicted of conspiracy to defraud customers, securities fraud and falsifying records. With tax, bank fraud and other counts that varied by defendant, they face maximum prison terms from 78 to 220 years.

""This largest-ever Ponzi scheme could not have been the work of one person,"" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. ""The scheme these defendants helped perpetrate cost innumerable investors their life savings. Now it likely will cost the defendants their freedom.""

The defendants -- who cried or choked back tears and embraced family members after the string of 59 separate guilty verdicts were read -- declined to comment as they left the courtroom with their heads down. Dismayed defense lawyers said appeals were likely.

""We're disappointed in the verdict,"" said Bonventre's lawyer Andrew Frisch. ""The list of Bernard Madoff's victims now includes these five former employees.""

""The name Madoff was a tall mountain to climb,"" said Crupi lawyer Eric Breslin. ""I'm not criticizing anyone, but that's just a fact.""

During the trial -- whose six-month duration was one of the longest Manhattan federal court observers could remember -- two of the defendants took the stand to assert their innocence. But jurors said Bongiorno and Bonventre didn't help themselves and didn't appear truthful. ""They seemed scripted,"" said juror Sheila Amato, a teacher from Rockland County.

O'Hara and Perez, the two computer programmers, both wrote letters to themselves in 2006, recording a meeting in which they told Madoff they were ""uncomfortable"" with some programs they were writing. Their lawyers argued the letters were exculpatory. But prosecutors said that instead of leaving, they kept working for Madoff, and jurors agreed -- attributing it to the hefty pay and perks all the defendants were getting.

""I feel sorry for them,"" Goldberg said. ""They should have walked away. But money is the root of all evil.""

Members of the panel said they largely accepted the testimony of Frank DiPascali, the former Madoff lieutenant and star government witness, who testified for nearly a month under a plea deal, and had few disagreements in the jury room.

""Bernie Madoff could not have done this on his own, as one person,"" said Amato. ""He would not have taken his trips to south France and left it all in the hands of one person. There had to be others involved.""

Before Monday's verdict, nine former Madoff employees -- including Madoff himself, in prison in North Carolina -- had pleaded guilty. In addition to the 14 convictions, one case remains outstanding.

Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain to immediately jail the five defendants. She refused, saying that with all of their assets already frozen, they had no ability to flee, but ordered them all to be outfitted with electronic monitoring bracelets.

The defendants and potential sentences

All five defendants were convicted of a number of conspiracy to defraud customers, securities fraud and falsifying records charges:

Daniel Bonventre, 67, of Manhattan, found guilty of 20 charges, faces a maximum of 220 years.

Unions Should Buy a Fast Food Franchise,http://gawker.com/unions-should-buy-a-fast-food-franchise-1573012632,"Today, the labor coalition leading the ongoing movement to raise wages for fast food workers announced that workers in 150 cities around the world will walk out and/ or strike on May 15. That's fine and dandy. But might there be a better way for this movement to operate?

The movement to unite fast food workers for higher wages and better working conditions has been going on longer than most people thought it ever would, and it's gained more support than many thought was possible. It is the single most visible ongoing labor movement targeting low-wage American workers, and that is just one reason it is extremely important. It represents an attempt to create some sort of real organized labor class at the very bottom of the income pyramid. In the context of growing income inequality and the vast American class war, it is a lone beacon of light from the flagging world of unions. It is hope.

It is also not really a labor campaign. It is a PR campaign. And that is completely rational. A real unionization campaign of American fast food workers would require resources so vast as to be almost impossible. There are just too many fast food workers, and the job turnover is incredibly high, and getting enough of them to become actual union members to make a serious industry-wide difference is a task that boggles the mind. A unionized fast food labor force would be great. But it is not going to happen in the foreseeable future.

What can happen, though, is that fast food wages can be raised and working conditions can be improved as a direct result of public relations pressure applied by this campaign. This campaign brings a lot of public attention to the awful conditions of fast food employees. It humanizes fast food employees. And it makes the fast food industry look greedy, small-minded, and un-American. Which they are! So we are always ready to offer our full-throated support to these fast food workers across the world, as they complain loudly about the raw deal they've been getting for too long.

That is PR. That is politics. Both are important. But the organized labor issue is also important. More important, in fact, since PR campaigns ask for improvements in working conditions and wages, whereas strong organized labor demands those improvements. So here is an idea for the union coalition leading this fast food campaign: unionize one store. One single store. One McDonald's location. Better yet, write a check to purchase and run a McDonald's franchise, unionize the work force, and prove to the world that it can run well and make a profit and serve all the Big Macs that anyone can want, while still treating workers well and paying a living wage. This would be an irrefutable testament to the viability of what the campaign is asking for. It would be proof that it can work. It would be more than a powerful PR tool; it would be a profit-and-loss statement that unions can hand over to the industry and say, ""See? This works.""

Big unions are spending millions of dollars on this campaign. Take a chunk of that money and start your own franchise. These arguments are all theoretical, until they aren't.

Candy Crush Saga to Debut On New York Stock Exchange Wednesday,http://www.franchiseherald.com/articles/5397/20140324/candy-crush-saga-to-debut-on-new-york-stock-exchange-wednesday.htm,"Mar 24, 2014 04:20 PM EDT | By Justin Stock

King, creator of the famous Candy Crush Saga smartphone game app will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time Wednesday.

According to the Associated Press, King might be worth up to $7.6 billion depending on how much its shares are set at.

If all goes according to plan, and the shares go for $24 each, which is the higher amount of the range, it will have double the amount compared to Zynga's Farmville.

King brought in $1.9 billion in income in 2013 according to information from CNET. This is an increase from $164 million in 2012, and $63.9 million in 2011 CNET reported.

""With King's tent-pole title, 'Candy Crush Saga,' currently tracking 20 (percent) below peak-booking levels, future growth will depend on the company's ability to diversify,"" Arvind Bhatia, analyst at Sterne Agee said in a statement the AP reported.

King invested $500 million Feb. 18 for it to be added on the NYSE.

King owns Candy Crush, and over 180 other games. Ninety-three million people play them on a regular basis.

Candy Crush Saga was first introduced on King's website before coming to Facebook last April Technology Tell reported. It then became available on Mobile Apps a year ago this month.

The game has since set records in Apple's iOS app store, and Google Play Store.

The app is bringing in the most money in the US App store, and many parts of the world Technology Tell reported.

More than 61 percent of players who have the game in the United Kingdom, compete while they are on their way to work in the morning Tech Crunch reported.

King had previously mentioned that issues with revenue could have surfaced if the IPO process was not successful.

""If the gross bookings of our top games, including Candy Crush Saga, are lower than anticipated and we are unable to broaden our portfolio of games or increase gross bookings from those games, we will not be able to maintain or grow our revenue, and our financial results could be adversely affected,"" the company said in a statement The Journal reported.",0,362,"Mar 24, 2014 04:20"," PM EDT | By Justin Stock King, creator of the famous Candy Crush Saga smartphone game app will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time Wednesday.

Why is Intel Corporation Soaring Today?,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/06/13/why-is-intel-corporation-soaring-today.aspx,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares had popped 6.9% higher as of 2 p.m. EDT Friday. The sudden move added 12 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) all by itself. Moving the price-weighted index this far in one day is impressive for a stock trading below $30 a share. By comparison, IBM (NYSE:IBM) would contribute or remove 11 points with just a 0.9% price change, given its near-$200 share price.

So what's the rocket fuel behind Intel's big move? Stocks often swing up or down for no apparent reason, but this is different. For once, this market-moving price change is motivated by a perfectly reasonable catalyst.

In a press release and an 8-K SEC filing last night, Intel effectively stepped out of the operating room with good news for the patient's relatives: The PC isn't dying, after all.

In more investor-friendly terms, Intel is seeing strong demand for business-grade PC systems. As a result, the company raised its second-quarter revenue outlook by 5% while narrowing the guidance range. For the full year, Intel now expects ""some revenue growth,"" up from a flat outlook.

Moreover, the chips that go into business PC systems tend to be high-margin products. Therefore, gross margin in the second quarter should land near 64% -- a 1% increase from the first-quarter report's guidance section. Full-year gross margin should land in the upper half of the previous projection, somewhere near 61%.

Here's how the new numbers fit into Intel's recent history. First, the gross-margin improvement is really good news:

As for revenue, Intel hasn't seen positive full-year sales growth since 2012. Any growth on this metric at all is good for Intel:

Intel's guidance update earns some extra gravitas from the fact that the company rarely changes its forecasts in midquarter. The chipmaker lowered its third-quarter sales guidance in mid-September 2012, about a month before the official report. Macroeconomic pressures were holding back personal-computer system sales, particularly in -- you guessed it -- the corporate PC market.

That warning sparked a 10-week selling spree. Intel shares fell nearly 30% while the Dow dropped just 4%. Intel sliced 47 points off the Dow in this period. I bought my Intel shares near the bottom of that trough. That wasn't market timing, just buying a quality business when everyone else was selling. And I locked in an effective dividend yield of 4.5%. Not too shabby.

""The rumors of Intel's demise have been blown out of proportion,"" I said at the time.

My position has grown by 48% as of today, or 55% if you include five quarters' worth of reinvested dividends. It feels good to be proven right, even when Intel's undervalued state should have been obvious in 2012.

According to The Wall Street Journal, this is the first time Intel raised guidance in the middle of a quarter since 2009. That sunny forecast boosted Intel shares by 4% the next day, while also driving archrival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) 6% higher.

AMD opened today's session 2.3% higher thanks to Intel's rosy market news. System-building titan Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) rose 2% overnight, since Intel's strong component sales point to a surging market for complete systems, too.

Meanwhile, IBM shares didn't react at all to Intel's PC-market news. Big Blue is selling its Intel-based server line to Chinese rival Lenovo, which also bought IBM's desktop and notebook operations a decade ago. IBM just doesn't have a dog in this particular race anymore, and is moving away from hardware sales in general.

'Most expensive divorce in history': Russian man ordered to pay $4.5B to ex-wife,http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/most-expensive-divorce-in-history-russian-man-ordered-to-pay-4-5b-to-ex-wife-1.1828358,"GENEVA -- A Swiss court has ordered a Russian billionaire to pay more than $4.5 billion to his ex-wife in what could become the biggest divorce settlement in history.

In papers delivered Monday to both parties, the Geneva Tribunal of First Instance said Dmitry Rybolovlev, an owner of the French soccer club AS Monaco, must pay 4,020,555,987.80 Swiss francs ($4,509,375,184.80) to ex-wife Elena Rybolovleva of Geneva. Both are aged 47.

The judgment also granted his ex-wife property worth 130.5 million francs ($146 million) in property in Gstaad, Switzerland, where the couple owned two swanky chalets. It awarded his ex-wife two other pieces of real estate in the ultra-wealthy area of Geneva known as Cologny, where the couple once lived together, but listed no value for either address. And it confirmed her custody of their 13-year-old daughter, Anna. The couple also has an adult daughter, Ekaterina.

Her lawyer Marc Bonnant called it ""the most expensive divorce in history,"" an unheard-of amount for Switzerland and for Russian oligarchs.

But Rybolovlev's lawyer said that the judgment's cash order was likely to be whittled down in coming appeals.

""There will definitely be a new appellate review and therefore this judgment is not final given the existence of two levels of appeal in Switzerland,"" said Tetiana Bersheda.

A separate statement by Bonnant and two other lawyers in the case, Corinne Corminboeuf Harari and Caroline Schumacher, called the record judgment ""a complete victory"" for her and said that under Swiss law she was entitled to half the fortune he made during their marriage. Most of that fortune was transferred to Cyprus-based trusts in 2005.

The three lawyers said Monday's ruling demonstrated that ""no one -- not even a Russian tycoon who put his fabulous fortune into legal structures such as trusts and offshore companies -- is above the law.""

But Rybolovlev's lawyer suggested the opposite, praising the judgment for ""confirming both the validity of the trusts created by Mr. Rybolovlev and the validity of the asset transfer to them that occurred long before his wife initiated divorce proceedings.""

His ex-wife had demanded $6 billion from the man known as the ""fertilizer king,"" whose fortune from potash mining once made him the world's 79th richest person. He is now ranked 147th on the Forbes list of billionaires, with an estimated fortune of $8.8 billion.

The couple met as university students in Perm, Russia, and married there in 1987. Divorce proceedings began in 2008, when Forbes estimated his worth at $12.8 billion.

A Geneva court had provisionally frozen Rybolovlev's assets in Switzerland and abroad, but it may prove difficult for Rybolovleva to obtain the money because Switzerland has no legal aid treaty with Cyprus.

In the United States, Rybolovlev and his daughter Ekaterina used trusts to acquire some of the priciest real estate in the country, including a penthouse apartment at Central Park West in New York and a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.",0,486,GENEVA -- A Swiss," court has ordered a Russian billionaire to pay more than $4.5 billion to his ex-wife in what could become the biggest divorce settlement in history.

Weibo shares surge in Nasdaq debut,http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2014/0417/609426-weibo-china-ipo/,"Shares of Sina Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, have jumped more than 25% in initial trade, after a disappointing initial public offering on the US Nasdaq exchange.

The offering yesterday was undersubscribed as Weibo's parent, the Chinese Internet giant Sina Corp, ran into a market jittery over both tech and Chinese company shares.

Weibo sought to raise as much as $380 million by selling 20 million shares for as much as $19 each, but only saw demand through underwriters for 16.8 million shares at the low end of the offer, $17.

That only brought the company $287 million.

Retail investors had more confidence, however, sending the shares soaring in early trade, topping $21 and valuing it at nearly $4.3 billion.

Weibo, launched in August 2009, is China's largest social media service with 144 million active monthly users.

It is most often compared to Twitter, but allows more content and functionality that lets it overlap with Facebook as well.

It has yet to make a profit, losing $38 million last year on revenues of $188 million, and another $47 million in the first quarter of this year, though revenues jumped to nearly $68 million for the three months.

Sina chief executive Charles Chao told AFP that Weibo is rapidly building income from display and performance-based ads.

""We are making great progress in both advertising areas, serving different clients bases from brand advertisers to SMEs (small and medium-sized firms) to e-commerce merchants,"" he said.

""There is no question that (Weibo's) revenue growth is much higher than our existing portal business.""

Critics say Weibo faces a challenge from rival network WeChat, owned by China's Tencent group, but Chao says the two are distinct.

While Weibo's messaging is open and public, WeChat users confine their messages to their own selected groups of followers, keeping discussions private and offering more protection from Beijing's censors.

Even so, he admits, the two compete with each other, in terms of time spent by the users. Yet Weibo has the advantage for advertisers, he insisted.

""Fundamentally... a public network is much more efficient than a private network,"" he said. ""A private network can never be efficient in terms of content distribution.""

Chao brushed off the poor IPO result, admitting the pricing was ""not ideal,"" but noting that most new share issues of the past week have not done well.

""It's a tough market... The entire IPO market is rather soft.

""To have a successful listing for us is probably the most important. We do not actually care too much about the temporary price for the stock,"" he said.

""If we can over the longer term keep executing our strategies and innovating in a very focused way, we can create shareholder value.""

He said China's economic slowdown was also not a problem for Sina or Weibo, and could possibly work to its advantage.

""Maybe a downturn in the economy will have some impact on the advertising business we are doing, but over the longer term, we're not concerned at all.""

""The Internet has proven that it is very resilient.... What the Internet does is, it increases the efficiency of everything, and so sometimes in bad times Internet companies can perform better.""

In New York for the IPO, Chao ran into numerous questions about China's tough censorship of the Internet and especially micro-blogging services where politically sensitive reports and commentary can spread quickly.

Chao repeatedly argues said Weibo has been a key player in reducing Beijing's control on information, and that China has progressed a lot.

But he also says that Sina has learned how to work within the rules to ensure its business stays up.

""There is no question that each country will have their own rules in terms of regulating the content industry or content behavior by users on the Internet... China is no exception,"" he argued.

""We are very experienced, in terms of complying with the laws and regulations in this area. So I don't think it's a big concern for us.""",0,664,"Shares of Sina Weibo,"," China's answer to Twitter, have jumped more than 25% in initial trade, after a disappointing initial public offering on the US Nasdaq exchange.

The Canadian dollar was slightly higher against most major currencies after reports emerged Monday morning suggesting US President Barack Obama may be considering easing sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea earlier today. However, it remained close above $1.25 late Tuesday afternoon amid concerns about further escalation between Ukraine and Moscow ahead both sides' escalating military exercises near the border. Ahead prices were also mixed with some traders cautioning investors not yet too far off their initial positions following recent moves towards closer ties among European Union member states such Asiana and Japan. In addition, shares fell sharply early Wednesday due largely because of fears Russian state television reported last night (March 28) that Ukrainian forces had captured several key government buildings along the Black Sea coast which have since become part or parcel out of eastern regions controlled by proton torpedoes fired during fighting recently. While tensions remain high across Europe however, there remains little sign of any significant change coming into effect until next week when talks begin regarding how much additional aid should come through later Thursday evening before moving forward toward finalizing terms once again without delay.

Why gold is just another speculation and not a safe haven,http://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-gold-is-just-another-speculation-and-not-a-safe-haven-cm366335,"The price of gold rose precipitously in the latter half of the last decade, largely driven by the belief that its value was driven by liquidity and not, as had previously been believed, inflation . It was a pipe dream, as we now know-an unforced error on the part of many who should have known better, softened only somewhat by the actions of the deliberately misled, who bought into a falling price of gold, thereby giving the big guys more time to get out.

While I've been bearish on gold in the past, I am neither bearish nor bullish at present. Still, I hope to persuade as many as possible of gold's inherent unpredictability, and of the always high probability that those who know ""for certain"" what it will do are really just those who have figured out ""for certain"" how to profit from convincing investors to behave in certain ways. In fact, neither increases nor decreases in quantitative easing and/or interest rates have a predictable impact on the price of gold. This, we saw more evidence of just last week, when James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, declared that interest rates would likely be raised in early 2015. The news should have been bearish for gold, at least in the short term, but gold doesn't actually play by anyone's made up rules-in fact, it trades almost entirely on investor psychology.

Because the utility of gold is its supposed safety, as opposed to, say, making a car travel from point A to point B, which is the utility of gasoline, gold's intrinsic value is far more variable. What too many proponents of gold will tell you is that its value rises based on how badly investors need safety, but in fact, this factor pales in comparison to another: how great is the market's faith that gold is safe?

No matter how badly the market may want a safe haven, too many investors were burned last year by gold for them to possibly regard it as safe, and they have no reason to, because if the illusion of gold's safety were to vanish entirely, there is nothing preventing its price falling to the levels it traded at five years ago.

So buy gold, if you are bullish, and sell it, if you are bearish-but don't try to convince yourself you have a sure bet, or even a sure hedge. Buy or sell gold coins if you must, but don't imagine the end result will be much different than if you had bought or sold SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ). Don't imagine anything at all, in fact, except that you have added one more speculative position to your portfolio.

Illegal oil tanker escapes Libyan escort,http://www.enca.com/africa/illegal-oil-tanker-escapes-libyan-escort,"TRIPOLI - A North Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an ""illegal"" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were escorting it to port on Tuesday, MPs said.

""The oil tanker took advantage of poor weather conditions to head for the open sea. The ships that were surrounding it were not in a position to follow it,"" said a member of the General National Congress, the country&39;s highest political authority.

Abdelkader Houili, a member of the GNC&39;s energy committee, told Al-Nabaa television that Libyan government ships had been forced to sail close to the coast because of the weather.

""The tanker then took advantage of the gap to head for the open sea,"" he said.

A second GNC member confirmed the vessel&39;s escape and the official LANA news agency quoted a third lawmaker as saying the Morning Glory had slipped its escort.

A government source and a spokesman for Libya&39;s state-owned National Oil Corporation were not immediately able to confirm the vessel&39;s escape when contacted by AFP.

Libyan authorities had said late on Monday that they had stopped the tanker as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra terminal, but a spokesman for ex-rebel fighters blockading the port insisted the ship was still under their control in the harbour.

Former rebels calling for autonomy for the eastern Cyrenaica region have been blockading Al-Sidra and other eastern oil export terminals since July.

Several ships have tried to dock at the rebel-held ports to take on oil but the North Korean-flagged Morning Glory, which docked on Saturday, is the first to actually do so.

The standoff at the ports has slashed Libyan oil exports from 1.5-million barrels per day to just 250,000, dealing a massive blow to the North African country&39;s key revenue earner.",0,295,TRIPOLI - A North," Korean-flagged tanker, carrying an ""illegal"" cargo of oil from a rebel-held terminal in eastern Libya, escaped the warships that were escorting it to port on Tuesday, MPs said.

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

TheStreet Ratings team rates ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CP as a Buy with a ratings score of A. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

""We rate ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CP (ZBRA) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations and solid stock price performance. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity.""

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 2.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 12.4%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

ZBRA has no debt to speak of therefore resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of zero, which we consider to be a relatively favorable sign. Along with this, the company maintains a quick ratio of 5.02, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cash needs.

Investors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company's shares by a sharp 46.75% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, ZBRA should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CP has improved earnings per share by 20.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CP increased its bottom line by earning $2.64 versus $2.35 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.45 versus $2.64).

The gross profit margin for ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CP is rather high; currently it is at 52.01%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 14.63% is above that of the industry average.

 China's economy grew at a slower pace in 2013 than expected due to an improving global financial system, according data released Tuesday showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast growth of 3.1 percent last year but revised that down from 2.5 per cent in 2012. However economists have said this was still below expectations as they did not include any changes made during previous years when economic activity slowed sharply. In contrast with earlier estimates, which suggested annualised GDP would be between 1.2-3 percent, analysts surveyed by Reuters were expecting it to be around 4% higher - although some believe its rise could come even lower if inflation remains low enough. This is because more people are working longer hours while also saving money; thus slowing demand will hurt investment prospects. Also see: “China’s slowdown?

Analysis:

TheStreet Quant Ratings

rates Hanesbrands as a

buy

. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, revenue growth, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations and reasonable valuation levels. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.

Highlights from the ratings report include:

Compared to its closing price of one year ago, HBI's share price has jumped by 66.34%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, HBI should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 14.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 12.0%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share.

37.25% is the gross profit margin for HANESBRANDS INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 3.92% trails the industry average.

Net operating cash flow has increased to -$62.24 million or 21.29% when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite an increase in cash flow of 21.29%, HANESBRANDS INC is still growing at a significantly lower rate than the industry average of 89.61%.

HANESBRANDS INC's earnings per share declined by 19.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, HANESBRANDS INC increased its bottom line by earning $3.25 versus $2.31 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($4.99 versus $3.25).

NEW YORK, June 26 (UPI) -- Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Thursday that the pricing pressures and a strengthening U.S. economy means the time is near for increasing short-term interest rates. In a speech at a NewYork event, Bullard said that the U.S. economy was strng enough to withstand an increase in short-term rates, given that growth is expected to pick up over the next few quarters. He said that Fed was close to achieving its employment and inflation targets and that he favored a rate increase in the first quarter of 2015. Advertisement

""I'm starting to think the economy could tolerate at least a little bit of the central bank getting back to a more normal stance,"" Bullard said.

Bullard said investors would be wise to listen carefully to the guidance given by the Federal Open Market Committee and that many investors and some Fed officials were stuck in 2010 and not understanding how the Fed was reaching its targets.

""Yes, it is a dovish committee, but I don't think investors should be pricing in an even more dovish committee than we've already got,"" Bullard said.

""I don't think financial markets have internalized how close we are to our ultimate goals, and I don't think the FOMC has internalized how close we are,"" he added.

Bullard said that the market was smart to not overreact to news last week that the U.S. economy experienced a 2.9 percent contraction in the first quarter and he personally felt that the economy was doing ""pretty good.""

""I am starting to think the economy could tolerate at least a little bit of the central bank getting back to a more normal stance,"" Bullard said.

After the last FOMC meeting, held on June 17-18, members said that inflation would reach 1.13 percent at the end of 2015 and 2.5 percent at the end of the following year.

When inflation moves above target, this will cause the discussion among Fed officials to ""heat up,"" Bullard said.

Malaysia marks grim Eid after MH17 crash,http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/World/230648-Malaysia-marks-grim-Eid-after-MH17-crash,"KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - Malaysia on Monday marked a solemn Eid al-Fitr, Islam s biggest festival, as families of those aboard downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 mourned the dead.

Prime Minister Najib Razak expressed his ""extreme sadness, most profound sympathy and deepest condolences"" to MH17 families, as well as relatives of those aboard another Malaysia Airlines jet, MH370, that went missing on March 8.

""Of course, I am able to feel and imagine what they would be going through when, upon waking up on the morning of Eid al-Fitr, their loved ones are not with them,"" he said in a televised address late Sunday.

Forty-three Malaysian passengers and crew were among the 298 people aboard flight MH17, which is believed to have been shot down by a missile over violence-wracked eastern Ukraine on July 17. None on board survived.

Eid marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and is usually a joyful time of family gatherings and feasting. Some 60 percent of Malaysia s 28 million people are Muslim.

Najib, a Muslim himself, had said he would try to bring back the Malaysian victims bodies before Eid, but officials have said it could take weeks more as the remains so far recovered are in Netherlands for identification and forensic work.

In his speech, Najib reiterated his promise to bring back the remains ""as soon as possible for burial"".

Some remains are still believed to be at the crash site.

Most of those aboard the Boeing 777 were Dutch, and Amsterdam is leading the investigation into the disaster.

- I won t celebrate without you -



Diyana Yazeera, daughter of MH17 chief stewardess Dora Shahila Kassim, posted on Twitter late Sunday that Eid, referring to it in the Malay language as Raya, would not be the same.

""Mummy, this year s raya and the upcoming ones, well will not be raya. Im not gonna celebrate it without you,"" she posted. ""Stop asking me to be strong. Its so hard to do.""

Zulkifli Abdul Rahman, brother-in-law of the other MH17 chief stewardess Azrina Yakob, said Azrina and her family, including her two young children, had planned to celebrate Eid in northern Malaysia.

""Without her presence this Raya will not be as happy,"" he told AFP at his home near the airport earlier. ""At all family functions, she made things very lively.""

In a mark of respect, Malaysia s government also cancelled all so-called ""open houses"", where Najib and other ministers usually host members of the public on the first day of Eid.

But Najib in his speech encouraged Malaysians to still visit each other and share food as is customary, as many families returned to their home towns to mark the day.

Monday s front page of the biggest English-language daily The Star showed the iconic blue batik of the Malaysia Airlines cabin crew uniform, and read ""MH370 and MH17: Our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their loved ones"".

Malaysia Airlines MH370 lost contact en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard, including 50 Malaysian passengers and crew.

"Best Buy Beats Views On Q1 Earnings, Misses On Sales",http://news.investors.com/technology/052214-701833-best-buy-stock-rises-on-q1-earnings-beat.htm,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy early Thursday posted first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations, but sales continued to be weak, missing views.

Still, Best Buy (BBY) stock was up 5% in early trading on the stock market today as investors focused on the company's improved profitability and market-share gains.

Best Buy earned 33 cents a share excluding items, on sales of $9.04 billion, in the quarter ended May 3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 20 cents and $9.21 billion.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share rose 3% and sales dipped 4%, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of declining sales.

Comparable U.S.-store sales slipped 1.3%. Sales growth in computers, video games and appliances failed to offset declines in tablets, home theater and services. Total same-store sales, including foreign stores, dipped 1.9%.

Best Buy did better than the overall consumer electronics market, which saw U.S. sales fall 2.6% in the 13 weeks ended May 3, vs. the year-earlier period, the company said, quoting NPD Group data.

Best Buy's operating income as a percent of revenue rose to 2.2% from 1.8% a year ago.

In its Renew Blue transformation, Best Buy has been aggressively cutting costs, improving efficiencies and bolstering its multichannel retail strategy. Its U.S. online sales rose 29% to $639 million in Q1.

Best Buy has cut prices to compete with discounters like Wal-Mart (WMT) and e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN). It also implemented price matching with Amazon and other competitors on customer request. Best Buy is fighting the ""showrooming"" trend, where consumers check out products in stores but then buy them for less online.

Best Buy did not give specific financial guidance, but expects sales to decline for the next two quarters because of a lack of compelling new products from manufacturers.

""As we look forward to the second and third quarters, we are expecting to see ongoing industry-wide sales declines in many of the consumer electronics categories in which we compete,"" Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam said in a statement. ""We are also expecting ongoing softness in the mobile phone category as consumers eagerly await highly-anticipated new product launches. Consequently, absent any major product launches, we are expecting comparable sales to be negative in the low-single digits in both the second and third quarters.""

For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Best Buy to earn 34 cents a share, up 6%, on sales of $9.17 billion, down 1%.

Sikorsky lands contract to build rescue chopper,http://www.14news.com/story/25883499/sikorsky-lands-contract-to-build-rescue-chopper,"NEW YORK (AP) - Aircraft maker Sikorsky says it received a $1.28 billion contract to build a new combat rescue helicopter for the Air Force.

The company says it will develop a new version of the Black Hawk helicopter and deliver four helicopters to the U.S. Air Force by 2020.

Sikorsky will also provide crew and maintenance training systems.

The company says the Air Force could expand the contract and order as many as 112 helicopters.

In March, the Air Force said it was moving forward with plans to have Sikorsky build the helicopter, but said Pentagon budget cuts could affect the program.

The recalls stem from two unrelated problems, and Chrysler knows of no accidents or injuries associated with either flaw.

2012-2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE & DODGE DURANGO

According to a press release from Chrysler, the Grand Cherokee/Durango recall is meant to address ""pedal feel"" on the vehicles' brakes. The automaker was contacted by a parts supplier, which believed that one of its components might be interfering with Chrysler's Ready Alert Braking system. That system ""primes brakes for optimal response when making a sudden stop"".

Upon investigation, Chrysler found that brake fluid in the Grand Cherokee and Durango was, in fact, being restricted, which caused diminished brake pedal feel. However, the company points out that ""Brake function was neither lost nor out of compliance with regulation"" as a result of the problem.

The flaw affects some 25,250 vehicles -- 18,700 purchased in the U.S., 825 in Canada, 530 in Mexico, and the remaining 5,200 located in other countries.

Chrysler hasn't issued a timeline for fixing the problem, but says that it will let owners know when they can take their vehicles to Chrysler dealers for free repairs. If you own one of the affected vehicles and have additional questions, you're encouraged to contact Chrysler directly at 800-853-1403.

2014 FIAT 500L

The Fiat 500L, on the other hand, is being recalled for a glitch in its transmission software. According to a press release:

Chrysler Group engineers launched an investigation after reviewing reports that some vehicles equipped with dual dry clutch automatic transmissions would not shift readily out of park and/or their transmissions did not receive, or were slow to receive, an intended gear selection.

The problem has been linked to a microcontroller associated with the transmission -- a component that Chrysler says might be ""compromised"" by extremes in temperature. That sounds like a mechanical problem, but the fix comes in the form of a software update (though Chrysler says that 200 of the recalled vehicles may require replacement of the shift-module to ensure compatibility with the new software).

All told, the Fiat recall affects around 19,500 vehicles, at least 20 percent of which are still on dealer lots. Approximately 18,100 of the recalled vehicles are located in the U.S., with the remaining 1,400 in Canada.

As with the Grand Cherokee and Durango recall, Chrysler hasn't indicated when it will begin notifying owners of the Fiat 500L recall. However, when it does, owners will be able to take their vehicles to Fiat dealers, who will fix them free of charge. For additional information, contact Chrysler at 800-853-1403.

MH370 search to be privatized,http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2014-06/04/content_17562461.htm,"MH370 search to be privatized: Australian coordinators Updated: 2014-06-04 13:55 (Xinhua)

SYDNEY - Three months after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished without a trace, search coordinators in Australia, Wednesday, released a request for tender to continue the as yet unsuccessful deep-water search in the Southern Ocean.

Sources close to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) Wednesday told Xinhua that a request for tender will be made to acquire the services of a specialist company capable of the challenging deep water search, with the US navy's Bluefin 21 winding up its involvement within the month.

According to the ATSB, engaged as a prime contractor, the company will provide the expertise, equipment and vessel(s) necessary to undertake an intensified underwater search for the missing Boeing 777 aircraft in the defined zone in the southern Ocean.

Last week the Joint Agency Co-ordination Center (JACC) said the missing Malaysia Airlines plane was not in the Indian Ocean search zone where acoustic ""pings"" had raised hopes of a breakthrough on April 7.

When the Australian navy's Ocean Shield reported two acoustic signals, with one held for more than two hours -- followed two days later with two more signals held for five minutes to seven minutes -- the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the last of many false dawns with his speech to parliament that he was 'very confident' the searchers had located the black box.

It was not to be.

MH370 went missing on March 8 about one hour into a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

""The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and, in its professional judgment, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370.""

The command center for the hunt moved from Perth in Western Australia to Canberra -- further from the scene of the action and a tacit suggestion that hopes of an imminent breakthrough have faded.

The best chance searchers had of locating any debris ended after 30 days (the limit of battery life for beacons on a black box, or flight recorders) of fruitless hunting deep in the Southern Ocean.

The lease that authorities have on the US Navy-owned underwater robot Bluefin-21, ends in another month and while the search team points out that at least 400 square kilometers of muddy-seabed have been excluded -- continuing the hunt over the entire 56,000 sq km area will more than likely take several years.

While the precise search zone is currently being established by an international search strategy working group, it is expected that the successful tenderer will now search an area up to 60,000 square kilometers based on the 'seventh handshake' arc where the aircraft last communicated with the Inmarsat satellite. Definition of the search zone will be finalized within two weeks to three weeks.

According to the ATSB, the successful tenderer will localize, positively identify and map the debris field of MH370 using specialist equipment such as towed and autonomous underwater vehicles with mounted sonar and/or optical imaging systems.

The intensified search will begin in August 2014 and is expected to take up to 12 months, depending on weather conditions. The successful tenderer will use the data from a bathymetric survey (already underway) to navigate the search zone, which has water depth between 1,000 meters and 6,000 meters.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing and vanished after losing contact with air traffic control on 8 March 2014, less than an hour after takeoff.

The Boeing 777-200ER, was carrying 12 Malaysian crew-members and 227 passengers from 14 nations.

  The US Navy has confirmed that it is conducting a ""surgical strike"" on suspected Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, after an Australian ship spotted debris from both ships and aircraft near where they were sighted over eastern Ukraine late Sunday.

“The crew of USS Kidd (DDG-47) was able confirm there are objects floating close to their radar,"" said Rear Admiral John Kirby of the UH60 Black Hawk helicopter unit at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Maryland. ‘We have been working with our partners closely for this operation since early morning.""

 A Chinese fishing boat also saw two pieces of wreckage off its surface scan plane last night but did not see any object until hours later when she arrived back home about 1am local time. Both vessels had earlier reported seeing what looked like black boxes or pings flying above them as well as other sounds emanating from the area around the missing jetliner. However, no one aboard either vessel could immediately identify anything suspicious so far because none of the planes involved appeared to have crashed into each other during the hunt today. It remains unclear whether these signals came directly out of the southern Indian Ocean - which lies between Russia's east and west coasts - nor if those same acoustic signatures might still exist within some areas currently being searched by air traffic control systems based in Australia. In addition yesterday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced he would step down following his own investigation regarding possible links between the Boeing 777 and Flight 370 while simultaneously announcing plans to launch fresh investigations related specifically towards how long ago such incidents happen.

  The US Navy has confirmed that it is conducting a ""surgical strike"" on suspected Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, after an Australian ship spotted debris from both ships and aircraft near where they were sighted over eastern Ukraine late Sunday.

“The crew of USS Kidd (DDG-47) was able confirm there are objects floating close to their radar,"" said Rear Admiral John Kirby of the UH60 Black Hawk helicopter unit at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Maryland. ‘We have been working with our partners closely for this operation since early morning.""

 A Chinese fishing boat also saw two pieces of wreckage off its surface scan plane last night but did not see any object until hours later when she arrived back home about 1am local time. Both vessels had earlier reported seeing what looked like black boxes or pings flying above them as well as other sounds emanating from the area around the missing jetliner. However, no one aboard either vessel could immediately identify anything suspicious so far because none of the planes involved appeared to have crashed into each other during the hunt today. It remains unclear whether these signals came directly out of the southern Indian Ocean - which lies between Russia's east and west coasts - nor if those same acoustic signatures might still exist within some areas currently being searched by air traffic control systems based in Australia. In addition yesterday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced he would step down following his own investigation regarding possible links between the Boeing 777 and Flight 370 while simultaneously announcing plans to launch fresh investigations related specifically towards how long ago such incidents happen. He told reporters: ’I will now focus my efforts fully on solving all outstanding issues relating...to find answers...

Pilgrim's Pride, which lost to Tyson Foods in a bidding war for Hillshire Brands, is open to other accusations, according to the company's CEO.

Bill Lovette said Pilgrim's will look to expand its poultry-processing operations by buying operations in regions of the country where it is not already a major presence.

Among other potential targets, analysts believe, are rivals such as Purdue Farms or Fieldale Farms.

Given how little debt Pilgrim's has, the company is well-positioned to borrow and fund acquisitions. And given that Tyson, which is already the biggest chicken processor in the country, will be a more formidable rival to Pilgrim's after the HIllshire buy, it seems inevitable that Pilgrim's will buy something soon.

Malaysia Rejects Criticism Of Lack Of Cooperation,http://news.airwise.com/story/view/1395154577.html,"Malaysia Rejects Criticism Of Lack Of Cooperation

March 18, 2014

Malaysia's senior official in charge of the search for Malaysia Airlines MH370 rejected criticism on Tuesday from US officials that it has not been sharing as much information as it could with foreign governments.

China has called for better coordination in the search operation now involving 26 countries, while some US officials and politicians have expressed frustration at what they see as Malaysia's refusal of help.

Malaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein specifically defended coordination with the United States and China and said he had been in touch with his counterparts in both countries.

""This morning, I was (speaking) with (US Defence Secretary) Chuck Hagel and then I was also with my counterpart (from) China,"" he told Reuters news agency.

Hishammuddin denied reports that Malaysia had discouraged the Federal Bureau of Investigation from sending a team to Malaysia.

""I have been working with them. It's up to the FBI to tell us if they need more experts to help because it's not for us to know what they have.""

Malaysian officials say they have been in touch with the FBI through the US embassy, where the agency has a permanent representative, from ""day one"".

""No matter what everyone says, the cooperation that I am getting for Malaysia and for what efforts I am doing, it is overwhelming,"" Hishammuddin said.

Two US security officials said on Monday that Malaysia had still not invited the FBI to send a team.

One source in Kuala Lumpur familiar with the investigation said an FBI team was in Malaysia to help with the probe. But another source familiar with the matter confirmed that no one had arrived from the United States to reinforce the FBI presence in the country.

An unprecedented search for the missing flight now stretches across Asia, from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean.

Investigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted the jet, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, perhaps thousands of miles off course.

EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE

The FBI has extensive experience in investigating plane disasters, including the crashes off the US east coast of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and Egyptair Flight 990 in 1999.

In the case of Egyptair 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot.

In the TWA 800 case, the FBI conducted a lengthy investigation that eventually helped the National Transportation Safety Board discredit theories that the plane was hit by a missile, but instead was brought down by a freak accident involving overheated fuel.

India, which has suspended search operations for the Malaysian plane pending a review of the satellite data, has said it had no complaints with the sharing of information.

""I think they (Malaysia) are sharing all the information. Every country has the capability up to their own airspace... So the information they have, they have shared,"" said Acquino Vimal, India's deputy high commissioner to Malaysia.

""I am yet to hear anything from our operational people saying that we are not getting information.""

The jet disappeared in a region beset by rivalries over military capabilities and where sovereignty can be a grey issue.

Furthermore, the need to co-operate has cast a potentially embarrassing light on regional surveillance capabilities, especially where the ability of nations to watch each other's airspace is concerned.

In Australia, a defence industry source said that any available information from its powerful radars pointing out to the Indian Ocean would likely be passed on to Malaysia in a ""highly sanitised way"" to conceal its origins and appease any concerns about Australian monitoring of neighbouring airspace.",0,613,Malaysia Rejects Criticism Of," Lack Of Cooperation March 18, 2014 Malaysia's senior official in charge of the search for Malaysia Airlines MH370 rejected criticism on Tuesday from US officials that it has not been sharing as much information as it could with foreign governments.

""No matter what everyone says, the cooperation that I am getting for Malaysia and for what efforts I am doing, it is overwhelming,"" Hishammuddin said. Two US security officials said on Monday that Malaysia had still not invited the FBI to send a team. One source in Kuala Lumpur familiar with the investigation said an FBI team was in Malaysia to help with the probe. But another source familiar with the matter confirmed that no one had arrived from the United States to reinforce the FBI presence in the country. An unprecedented search for the missing flight now stretches across Asia, from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean. Investigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted the jet, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, perhaps thousands of miles off course. EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE The FBI has extensive experience in investigating plane disasters, including the crashes off the US east coast of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and Egyptair Flight 990 in 1999. In the case of Egyptair 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot. In the TWA 800 case, the FBI conducted a lengthy investigation that eventually helped the National Transportation Safety Board discredit theories that the plane was hit by a missile, but instead was brought down by a freak accident involving overheated fuel. India, which has suspended search operations for the Malaysian plane pending a review of the satellite data, has said it had no complaints with the sharing of information. ""I think they (Malaysia) are sharing all the information. Every country has the capability up to their own airspace... So the information they have, they have shared,"" said Acquino Vimal, India's deputy high commissioner to Malaysia. ""I am yet to hear anything from our operational people saying that we are not getting information."" The jet disappeared in a region beset by rivalries over military capabilities and where sovereignty can be a grey issue. Furthermore, the need to co-operate has cast a potentially embarrassing light on regional surveillance capabilities, especially where the ability of nations to watch each other's airspace is concerned. In Australia, a defence industry source said that any available information from its powerful radars pointing out to the Indian Ocean would likely be passed on to Malaysia in a ""highly sanitised way"" to conceal its origins and appease any concerns about Australian monitoring of neighbouring airspace."," China's Military Actions In The South China Sea
The Philippines' Defense Minister, Benigno Aquino III, said on Tuesday that the United States and its allies have ""conclusively"" rejected claims by Malaysia to sovereignty over islands in the disputed waters.

Bitcoin now legal alternative to US dollar in California,http://www.cityam.com/1404129983/bitcoin-now-legal-alternative-us-dollar-california,"Bitcoin now legal alternative to US dollar in California

The governor of California has signed assembly bill 129, which gives Bitcoin and other digital currencies the status of legal money.

Jerry Brown's signature has finally clarified Bitcoin as valid form of payment in the golden state after AB-129 was passed in February by the California Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee by a 7-1 vote.

The bill was intended to update the existing state law under which alternative forms of value were being used illegally, as well as provide a more hospitable environment for California's fast growing Bitcoin community.

The bill repeals arcane state restrictions on the use of anything but USD as currency. However, the dollar retains legal superiority over cryptocurrencies and other forms of money.

Author of the bill, Roger Dickinson, commented: ""In an era of evolving payment methods, from Amazon Coins to Starbucks Stars, it is impractical to ignore the growing use of cash alternatives"".

""This bill is intended to fine-tune current law to address Californians' payment habits in the mobile and digital fields"", he added.

It is perhaps unsurprising that California has taken this step, since it is home to a host of Bitcoin businesses and venture capital funds. According to digital currency new site Coindesk, around 40 per cent of Bitcoin professionals come from California.

Brown's decision to sign off on AB-129 will give further hope to those who wish to see Bitcoin expand further into the mainstream, providing a fresh alternative to state-controlled money.

Many enthusiasts for cryptocurrency have long hoped that private monies will outcompete or at the very least put pressure on state-backed fiat money.

Earlier this month, the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) published New Private Monies: A Bit-Part Player? examining contemporary cases of private monetary systems, including Bitcoin.

Author of the paper, Kevin Dowd, a professor of finance and economics at Durham University, argued that money, like any other good or service, is best provided through a competitive free market.

He called for legal tender laws to be abolished and the government should be willing to accept taxes in the form of private money.

On the more radical side of what cryptocurencies could achieve, the paper lists the ability of individuals to free themselves to purchase illegal drugs, engage in illegal forms of gambling and protect their wealth from predatory governments.

One Of The Music Industry's Smartest Insiders Wrote About Why Apple Might Buy  ...,http://www.businessinsider.in/sai/One-Of-The-Music-Industrys-Smartest-Insiders-Wrote-About-Why-Apple-Might-Buy-Beats-Last-Month/articleshow/34852053.cms,"While most of us are totally shocked by the news that Apple is late stage talks to buy Beats audio for $3.2 billion, there's one person who saw it coming - music industry insider Bob Lefsetz

On April 1, in what some people might have confused for an April Fool's joke, Lefsetz predicted this would happen.

He said that Apple would pay $1 billion for Beats, which is off slightly. But, he did predict it. His rationale is that Apple needs a streaming service, and Beats it the way to do it.

Here's his analysis:

Cook wanted to launch the service in September, with the iPhone 6, but now with Scott Forstall gone, Apple software development is still in disarray, and this timetable is impossible, so the launch will come in the new year, right after Christmas, before the Super Bowl, when Cook is scheduled to appear on the Howard Stern show to introduce the product.



That's right, Stern now has more impact than football, and as a lover of Apple products he's willing to host Cook for free. Furthermore, with endless reruns on both Howard 100 and Howard 101, the message will continue to get out. And, the interview will stream free on iTunes Radio, so you won't need a satellite subscription to hear it.



Cook was very close to making a deal with Rush Limbaugh instead, but Rush's hatred of gays queered the deal. That's right, despite being an Apple fanboy, Rush's political positions did him in.



As for Cook's request that his sex life be off limits on Stern's show...Gary Dell'Abate told me that Howard will not negotiate, everything's fair game.



So where does this leave us?



1. Streaming wins. People have been waiting for years for Apple to get into the market, now it has. Is it too late? Apple owned the portable music sphere with its iPod, no one else could get traction, but Android has significant market share in phones. Therefore, despite Cook portraying this as a breakthrough acquisition, it's really about catching up.



2. Jimmy Iovine demonstrates that he's a winner, that all the naysayers are wrong. He went on ""American Idol"" with those godforsaken Beats headphones around his neck and he willed them to be successful. Now that he's unloaded Beats Music, rumor has it that Iovine will be shepherding a return to rock movement, saying it's all about being able to play your instrument and that hip-hop is dead. He will reunite Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty for another duet, maybe around the time of the Apple/Beats launch, Jimmy has always known it's about marketing.



3. Spotify is history. Daniel Ek is no competition for Apple. In tech timing is everything. Spotify fought the war, got customers softened up to embrace streaming, Apple will gain the lion's share of the revenue (and yes, there will be an Android version of the Apple/Beats streaming service, it will launch simultaneous with the Apple version, just like iPod for Windows broke Apple through, Cook is taking no chances, he's replicating the formula.)



4. Tim Cook shows that he is willing to go against Steve Jobs's wishes, that Apple is now truly his company.



5. Once again, the money flows to the techies. Yes, Iovine got paid, but only once, he's got no ongoing remuneration coming from Apple, like Ian Rogers, he's out.



So the war is over. Our long national nightmare is history. We've evolved from CDs to piracy to the iTunes Store to legal streaming services. Now the person proffering the best music wins. Distribution is available to everyone, if not marketing dollars. Then again, just like Apple has been jawboning labels for exclusives, expect this behavior to continue on the Apple/Beats service, home page real estate continues to be valuable.



And one more thing...



YouTube's streaming music heyday is about to end. As part of the Beats deal, the heads of the three major labels have secretly agreed not to renew their YouTube licenses. You can't win unless you kill the competition, and Tim Cook has made a preemptive strike.",0,679,While most of us," are totally shocked by the news that Apple is late stage talks to buy Beats audio for $3.2 billion, there's one person who saw it coming - music industry insider Bob Lefsetz On April 1, in what some people might have confused for an April Fool's joke, Lefsetz predicted this would happen.

Spotify fought the war, got customers softened up to embrace streaming, Apple will gain the lion's share of the revenue (and yes, there will be an Android version of the Apple/Beats streaming service, it will launch simultaneous with the Apple version, just like iPod for Windows broke Apple through, Cook is taking no chances, he's replicating the formula.) 4. Tim Cook shows that he is willing to go against Steve Jobs's wishes, that Apple is now truly his company. 5. Once again, the money flows to the techies. Yes, Iovine got paid, but only once, he's got no ongoing remuneration coming from Apple, like Ian Rogers, he's out. So the war is over. Our long national nightmare is history. We've evolved from CDs to piracy to the iTunes Store to legal streaming services. Now the person proffering the best music wins. Distribution is available to everyone, if not marketing dollars. Then again, just like Apple has been jawboning labels for exclusives, expect this behavior to continue on the Apple/Beats service, home page real estate continues to be valuable. And one more thing... YouTube's streaming music heyday is about to end. As part of the Beats deal, the heads of the three major labels have secretly agreed not to renew their YouTube licenses. You can't win unless you kill the competition, and Tim Cook has made a preemptive strike."," are familiar with the old-school, high school football game between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati in which a team is forced to run for its first touchdown on third down.

Call for end to anti-China protests,http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/call-for-end-to-antichina-protests-30281893.html,"Mobs burned and looted scores of foreign-owned factories in Vietnam following a large protest by workers against China's placement of an oil rig in disputed waters (AP)

Vietnam's prime minister has ordered an end to all ""illegal protests"" in the country after a week of violent demonstrations against China's deployment of an oil rig in a disputed section of the South China Sea.

Last weekend, Vietnam's government took the unusual step of allowing anti-China street protests - a move widely seen as a way for the authoritarian state to show its displeasure with Beijing for positioning the oil rig in strategic waters claimed by both countries.

But now Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said the ministry of public security and provincial governments had been ordered to ""conduct concerted and determined measures not to allow illegal protests that cause security and social order disturbances"".

All protests are technically illegal in Vietnam.

The message appears to represent a shift in government policy regarding the anti-China protests. On Thursday, the PM sent a message calling for heightened patriotism.

Nationalist and dissident groups, which are also demanding basic democratic reforms that challenge Vietnam's Communist Party, have called for large protests on Sunday in front of the Chinese embassy in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam.

The public mood in Vietnam is currently anti-Beijing, and breaking up the rallies might reinforce dissident claims that the government is kowtowing to China.

In the past, authorities have allowed small anti-China protests to take place for a limited period.

The public unrest this past week was the most serious to hit Vietnam in years.

Dozens of factories close to Ho Chi Minh City were trashed following peaceful anti-China protests by workers.

In central Vietnam, a 1,000-strong mob stormed a steel mill, killing one Chinese worker and wounding hundreds more. Hundreds of Chinese and Taiwanese people have fled the country by land and air.

There has been no reported violence or major demonstrations since Thursday.

Earlier this month, Vietnam's government sent a flotilla to confront Chinese vessels protecting the oil rig, setting off a tense stand-off.

The government also whipped up patriotic fervour via state media, undoubtedly swelling the numbers of protesters, while also trying to rally international support for its cause. The street protests last weekend were the largest in years in Vietnam.

The government has condemned the violence, which it said was carried out by ""extremists"".

In a phone conversation with his Vietnamese counterpart, Chinese public security minister Guo Shengkun urged Vietnam to protect Chinese companies and nationals, according to a statement posted on the ministry's website. He also demanded that Vietnam severely punish those involved in the violence.

In 2011, Chinese vessels cut a supply cable to a Vietnamese oil exploration vessel in the South China Sea, angering Vietnam's government.

Vietnam allowed protests for a while before gradually cracking down on them after they became a forum for anti-government activists.",0,487,Mobs burned and looted," scores of foreign-owned factories in Vietnam following a large protest by workers against China's placement of an oil rig in disputed waters (AP) Vietnam's prime minister has ordered an end to all ""illegal protests"" in the country after a week of violent demonstrations against China's deployment of an oil rig in a disputed section of the South China Sea.

In central Vietnam, a 1,000-strong mob stormed a steel mill, killing one Chinese worker and wounding hundreds more. Hundreds of Chinese and Taiwanese people have fled the country by land and air. There has been no reported violence or major demonstrations since Thursday. Earlier this month, Vietnam's government sent a flotilla to confront Chinese vessels protecting the oil rig, setting off a tense stand-off. The government also whipped up patriotic fervour via state media, undoubtedly swelling the numbers of protesters, while also trying to rally international support for its cause. The street protests last weekend were the largest in years in Vietnam. The government has condemned the violence, which it said was carried out by ""extremists"". In a phone conversation with his Vietnamese counterpart, Chinese public security minister Guo Shengkun urged Vietnam to protect Chinese companies and nationals, according to a statement posted on the ministry's website. He also demanded that Vietnam severely punish those involved in the violence. In 2011, Chinese vessels cut a supply cable to a Vietnamese oil exploration vessel in the South China Sea, angering Vietnam's government. Vietnam allowed protests for a while before gradually cracking down on them after they became a forum for anti-government activists."," stores, forcing the government to intervene.

The same parliamentary source said the North Korean oil tanker Morning Glory is now in international waters. The tanker distanced itself after illegally loading crude on behalf of a separatist group from eastern Libya.

"As Amazon Tightens Market Grip, Flipkart and Snapdeal Prepare for Tougher  ...",http://www.ibtimes.co.in/amazon-tightens-market-grip-flipkart-snapdeal-prepare-tougher-competition-600758,"With Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) ramping up its presence in India, two local online retailers are preparing for tougher competition with separate deals worth a combined $400 million set to be finalised this week.

Flipkart, India's largest online retailer, is expected on Thursday to announce its acquisition of a majority stake in online fashion retailer Myntra in a deal worth about $300 million, said an official from Myntra who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak with the media.

In a separate deal, local online retailer Snapdeal has raised $100 million from five investors, a company official said on Wednesday. The deal will be announced in a few days, he said.

The Snapdeal investors include Temasek Holdings, an official with the Singapore state investor said.

The two deals come after Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, last year slashed prices and rolled-out next-day delivery in a bid to win market share in India's fast-growing e-commerce industry.

""Amazon is scaling up .... much faster than expected and that is forcing everyone from retailers to investors in these companies to re-think,"" said Ashish Jhalani, founder of e-tailing India, a retail consultancy.

""The sentiment here at the moment is about survival, it's about now or never,"" he said.

Bangalore-based Flipkart, set up by two ex-Amazon employees in 2007, has sought to grow its presence in the online fashion segment, a category where Myntra is the market leader.

Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners are investors in both Flipkart and Myntra.

Flipkart and Myntra declined to comment.

Snapdeal, an online marketplace that facilitates transactions between third party suppliers and customers, is set to complete its second round of funding this year by raising $100 million, the company official said.

The official declined to be named and did not provide details. Snapdeal Chief Executive Officer Kunal Bahl was not immediately available for comment.

The Economic Times newspaper, citing an unnamed source, reported on Tuesday that other investors in Snapdeal included BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Hong Kong-based Myriad Asset Management. Myriad declined to comment and BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.

The Indian e-commerce market was worth $13 billion in 2013, according to a joint report by KPMG and the Internet and Mobile Association of India, with online travel accounting for over 70 percent of consumer e-commerce transactions last year.

Online sales of retail goods totaled $1.6 billion in 2013, according to research firm Forrester, and are expected to reach $76 billion by 2021, according to consultancy Technopak.

“The United States is committed to its allies, partners—and their interests,” said Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday during his first official visit abroad since taking office after leaving Washington last month. ‘We are determined to ensure that our people have access unimpeded to critical infrastructure so they can make informed decisions about where they live, work, study, travel, and engage with each other. We will continue to do everything we can to help them achieve this goal."" He added: ’Our commitment remains strong; however, there has been no change at all from what I've seen over the past several weeks. …I want you guys today not only to know how important these issues are but also why America stands ready to act if needed when faced up against challenges around those who threaten us. This trip underscores just exactly which side Americans stand on — whether united behind one country or opposing another. It shows both an interest in advancing peace and security across borders and understanding between nations while simultaneously demonstrating leadership within countries' systems of governance. And because every effort should be made to keep American businesses here, working hard toward making sure everyone feels welcome, my administration continues to support efforts to strengthen rules governing foreign investment in US companies and encourage greater transparency regarding such investments. In particular,"" he told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Paris following his arrival in Brussels.

US interest rates not set to soar,http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/10067779/US-interest-rates-not-set-to-soar,"The US Federal Reserve should be able to raise interest rates slowly when it eventually tightens monetary policy given that slack in the US economy is restraining inflation, a top official at the central bank said on Tuesday.

New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said the American economy was poised for stronger growth and inflation should ""drift upwards"" towards the Fed's 2 per cent goal. But a swift climb in inflation was unlikely, he said.

""My current thinking is that the pace of tightening will probably be relatively slow,"" Dudley told a group of business economists in New York. He also reiterated that the central bank would wait a ""considerable time"" after winding down its bond-buying stimulus programme before raising rates from near zero.

Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser offered a more hawkish view during a speech in Washington, warning that the central bank risked waiting too long for a rate hike.

""As we continue to move closer to our 2 per cent inflation goal and the labor market improves, we must be prepared to adjust policy appropriately,"" he said. ""That may well require us to begin raising interest rates sooner rather than later.""

Both Plosser and Dudley have votes on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year, but Dudley's views are considered to be more in the mainstream of thinking at the central bank.

The Fed is grappling with several major issues, including when to raise interest rates and when to start scaling back its more than US$4 trillion ($4.7 trillion) balance sheet.

In a signal of a shift in the thinking at the central bank, Dudley said the Fed should consider continuing to reinvest proceeds from the bonds it holds until after it raises rates.

Previously, the central bank had said letting the bonds roll off to shrink its balance sheet would likely come first, but Dudley said that could lead markets to believe a rate hike is coming sooner than the Fed might intend.

Dudley also suggested the Fed could rely heavily on a new tool - its so-called reverse repo facility - to help control rates when it does finally begin to tighten policy.

After more than five years of highly accommodative monetary policy, including near zero interest rates and massive bond purchases, the Fed is beginning to face pressure from so-called inflation hawks, such as Plosser, who are worried the central bank might unleash inflation.

Dudley signalled little concern, and said he would be as comfortable having inflation a bit above the Fed's 2 per cent target as below it.

""My own view is that 2 percent is definitely not a ceiling,"" he said, adding that he would be more tolerant of inflation if unemployment remained well above the level the Fed views as consistent with full employment.

The core price index the Fed tracks most closely stood at just 1.2 per cent in March, and while the jobless rate dropped sharply in April, at 6.3 per cent it is still well above the 5.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent range most officials associate with full employment.",0,513,The US Federal Reserve," should be able to raise interest rates slowly when it eventually tightens monetary policy given that slack in the US economy is restraining inflation, a top official at the central bank said on Tuesday.

Fracking in California's Monterey Shale will recover 96 percent less oil than  ...,http://www.salon.com/2014/05/21/fracking_in_californias_monterey_shale_will_recover_96_percent_less_oil_than_thought/,"The promise of fracking in California's large Monterey Shale deposits was intoxicating: 13.7 billion barrels of oil, as estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, were recoverable with existing technology, enough to bring 2.8 million new jobs to the state and boost tax revenue by $24.6 billion per year.

But the independent firm hired to evaluate the shale back in 2011 made the very incorrect assumption that the Monterey deposits would be as easy to tap as those in North Dakota and Texas -- and that turns out not to be the case. A new, revised estimate slashes that promise by 96 percent, putting the amount of recoverable oil at only 600 million barrels.

The L.A. Times, which first reported the news, calls it ""a blow to the nation's oil future"" -- the Monterey Shale contains about two-thirds of the nation's shale oil reserves:

The new analysis from the Energy Information Administration was based, in part, on a review of the output from wells where the new techniques were used. ""From the information we've been able to gather, we've not seen evidence that oil extraction in this area is very productive using techniques like fracking,"" said John Staub, a petroleum exploration and production analyst who led the energy agency's research. ""Our oil production estimates combined with a dearth of knowledge about geological differences among the oil fields led to erroneous predictions and estimates,"" Staub said. Compared with oil production from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, ""the Monterey formation is stagnant,"" Staub said. He added that the potential for recovering the oil could rise if new technology is developed.

Oil industry officials are holding on to that promise, maintaing that since the oil is there, they'll eventually find a way to get to it. But environmentalists, for the time being, are declaring this the end of California's petroleum rush:",0,316,The promise of fracking," in California's large Monterey Shale deposits was intoxicating: 13.7 billion barrels of oil, as estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, were recoverable with existing technology, enough to bring 2.8 million new jobs to the state and boost tax revenue by $24.6 billion per year.

Death toll rises as violence in eastern Ukraine escalates,http://www.independent.ie/world-news/death-toll-rises-as-violence-in-eastern-ukraine-escalates-30311471.html,"A Pro-Russian militia man walks at a checkpoint on a road leading to the airport in Donetsk (AP)

Dozens of dead insurgents lay piled in a van outside a morgue, and a rebel said more were on the way.

Bomb disposal experts disarmed a mortar round lodged in a corpse. A wrecked and blood-soaked truck at the Donetsk airport showed the grisly aftermath of battle.

The fight for eastern Ukraine seems to have taken a ferocious turn, as both sides step up their attacks after the rebellious regions mostly boycotted a presidential election that delivered a decisive winner.

Following a day and night of the heaviest and most sustained assault by Ukrainian government forces to date, the pro-Russia separatist movement finds itself facing an emboldened and resolute national leadership.

With Sunday's election of billionaire Petro Poroshenko to the presidency, Kiev has received grudging and tentatively positive diplomatic overtures from Russia.

Leaders of the 28 EU countries, meeting in Brussels, said they expect Russia to co-operate with the newly elected president.

In a statement, the EU heads of state and government said Moscow should ""use its leverage on the armed separatists to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine"".

But with evidence that irregulars are continuing to pour into Ukraine from Russia, it remains unclear whether the Kremlin is encouraging fighters whose attack on Monday on the Donetsk International Airport showed their increasing aggression.

What is certain is that the Ukrainian government's anti-insurgent operation has been kicked into a higher a gear, with the military unleashing fighter jets, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery.

Government opponents insist they have taken up arms to defend eastern Ukraine's Russian-speaking population and have appealed to Moscow for assistance. Kiev condemns the insurgents as ""terrorists"" bent on tearing the country apart.

Donetsk Mayor Oleksandr Lukyanchenko said 40 people, including two civilians, were killed in fighting after government troops thwarted a rebel attempt to seize the airport, Ukraine's second-largest.

The bodies of about 30 insurgents were brought yesterday morning to the Kalinin Hospital morgue, said Leonid Baranov of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.

The fighters had been wounded and were being transported to a hospital in a truck when it was shot up by government forces, he said.

Mr Baranov said up to 100 rebels were probably killed in combat, but many bodies had not yet been recovered because they were in areas under government control. His death toll could not be independently confirmed.

""As they are controlling the airport and the fight was there... we cannot right now identify exactly how many victims we have,"" he said, adding that hundreds were also wounded.

After being squeezed out of the airport following hours of intense fighting, insurgents called in several hundred reinforcements.

Many were from a unit calling itself the Vostok - or East - Battalion, which Donetsk People's Republic representatives have said includes combatants from Russia's North Caucasus.

Later, Ukrainian forces pounded rebel positions, forcing the fighters to retreat in disarray.

In an emergency televised address, the Donetsk mayor warned residents to stay indoors but also gave assurances that government troops would not push into the city centre.

After Mr Poroshenko claimed victory in the election, hopes were raised of a push for unification in the deeply divided nation. He has vowed to negotiate a peaceful end to the insurgency.

But he also compared the separatists to lawless ""Somali pirates"" and promised he would stop them from sowing more chaos.

US President Barack Obama, who spoke with Mr Poroshenko by phone yesterday, plans to meet him while in Europe early next month, the White House said.

Mr Poroshenko, who has not yet been sworn in, pending official confirmation of the results, said his first step as president would be to visit the troubled east.

He said he hoped Russia would support his efforts to bring stability, and that he wanted to hold talks with Moscow.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov voiced strong concern about Ukraine's intensifying military operations, and called for an immediate end to the fighting.",0,670,A Pro-Russian militia man," walks at a checkpoint on a road leading to the airport in Donetsk (AP) Dozens of dead insurgents lay piled in a van outside a morgue, and a rebel said more were on the way.

Will P&G (PG) Disappoint This Earnings Season? - Analyst Blog,http://www.nasdaq.com/article/will-pg-pg-disappoint-this-earnings-season-analyst-blog-cm345814,"The Procter & Gamble Company ( PG ) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Apr 23, before the market opens. Last quarter, it delivered positive earnings surprise of 0.83%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.

Factors to Consider this Quarter

Currency headwinds, rising commodity costs, increasing competitive pressures, challenging consumer spending environment in the U.S. and volatile market dynamics in other countries are expected to hurt results in the third quarter. In fact, P&G lowered its fiscal 2014 sales and earnings forecasts in Feb 2014 to reflect the recent emerging-market currency devaluations.

In the second half of fiscal 2014, management expects stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter than the third driven by accelerated productivity gains and cost savings, moderating currency headwinds, greater impact from new product innovation, accelerated pricing and no further negative impact from manufacturing start-up costs.

Earnings Whispers?

Our proven model does not conclusively show that P&G is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

Negative Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is -0.98%.

Zacks Rank: P&G's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a negative ESP lowers the predictive power of ESP.

We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.

Other Stocks to Consider

Other stocks in the retail sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:

Church & Dwight Co. Inc. ( CHD ), with Earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Reynolds American Inc. ( RAI ), with Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated. ( CAKE ), with Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Allergan Plans To Reject Valeant's C$46 Bln Offer : Report,http://www.rttnews.com/2319298/allergan-plans-to-reject-valeant-s-c-46-bln-offer-report.aspx\?type=cn,"Allergan Inc. (AGN), which is famous for its wrinkle treatment drug Botox, is preparing to reject the $46 billion cash and stock offer by Canadian drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX,VRX.TO). Allergan could publicly reject the offer as early as Monday, Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter.

The company is expected to raise concerns that Valeant would slash research and development as a reason for refusing the offer. Allergan is also likely to hit back at Valeant for using stock to make up over two thirds of its total offer, the report said quoting those people.

A rejection would be a blow to Valeant and Bill Ackman, the activist investor who owns a 9.7 per cent stake in Allergan and teamed up with the drugmaker to launch the takeover attempt. However, both have signalled their intention to pursue Allergan through tougher means if needed, the report indicated.

In April, Valeant announced that it submitted a merger proposal to acquire Allergan for $48.30 in cash and 0.83 Shares of Valeant stock for each Allergan share. The offer valued Allergan at around $46 billion. Following the proposed merger, Allergan shareholders will own 43 percent of the combined company.

ECB's Noyer: Low inflation may hamper adjustment,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecbs-noyer-low-inflation-may-hamper-adjustment-2014-03-10,"PARIS--The slow pace of price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday.

""The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability.""

A country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero.

Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term.

Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.

""Low inflation is not deflation,"" Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. ""There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages.""

He warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.

""The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking.""

The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.

Write to Gabriele Parussini at gabriele.parussini@wsj.com",0,372,PARIS--The slow pace of," price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday. ""The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability."" A country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero. Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term. Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation. ""Low inflation is not deflation,"" Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. ""There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages."" He warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched. ""The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking."" The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.

Discount carriers take low-cost road to success,http://www.ecns.cn/business/2014/06-27/121250.shtml,"Second-largest aviation market drawing attention of new budget airline companies across Asia Pacific

Low-cost airlines from around the region are taking to the skies in the mainland market, where they aim to meet huge demand from domestic travelers for new destinations around Asia.

HK Express, the only low-cost carrier in Hong Kong, will soon open service on its second route to the mainland - Ningbo, Zhejiang province.

""The move represents our commitment to carving a foothold in the Chinese mainland,"" said Andrew Cowen, deputy chief executive officer of HK Express.

The company, which currently flies to 13 popular destinations throughout Asia, launched daily flights to Kunming, Yunnan province, last October.

Starting Aug 1, the airline will operate five flights a week between Hong Kong and Ningbo.

Along with opening new routes on the mainland, the company will also open more international flights to neighboring destinations to cater to the ""overwhelming demand"" from mainland travelers, according to Cowen.

""We are offering low-cost, efficient ... air services for travelers in Asia, especially those in the Pearl River Delta, which neighbors Hong Kong, as a growing number of people have developed an interest in traveling throughout southeastern and northeastern Asia,"" Cowen told China Daily.

The low-cost flight provider will expand its destinations to 20 by the end of 2014, of which most will be popular tourist destinations in Asia. It also plans to recruit 300 new cabin crew members by the end of 2015, sources with the company said.

""We believe that the company will become a market leader in low-cost flights, as Hong Kong provides an ideal geographic advantage in attracting travelers from the Chinese mainland,"" Cowen said.

Sources with Malaysia's AirAsia, which has dominated budget air travel in Asia with explosive growth over the past decade, said it plans to continue its growth in the Chinese market, doubling its passenger volume by the end of 2015.

Square Begins Lending to Small Businesses,http://www.paymentssource.com/news/square-begins-lending-to-small-businesses-3018019-1.html,"Square has launched Square Capital, a credit program for small business, joining a growing number of companies breaking into small-business lending.

The program closely resembles PayPal's Working Capital, in that it allows merchants to pay back loans from the sales they handle through the payment provider and lending decisions are based on a merchant's transaction history.

Eurozone Manufacturing Growth Remains Stable In July,http://www.rttnews.com/2361845/eurozone-manufacturing-growth-remains-stable-in-july.aspx,"Eurozone manufacturing activity growth remained stable at June's seven-month low, final data from Markit Economics showed Friday.

The final seasonally adjusted manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 51.8 in July, unchanged from June. The flash score for July was 51.9.

The ongoing expansions in Germany and outside of the big-two economies were partly offset by a deeper downturn at French manufacturers.

At the same time, the German manufacturing sector sustained its growth in July. The Markit/BME manufacturing PMI rose to 52.4 in July from an eight-month low of 52 in June. But the July figure was below the flash estimate of 52.9.

On the other hand, the French manufacturing sector weakened in July, but slightly less than initially estimated.

The headline French PMI dropped to revised 47.8 from 48.2 in June. That was its lowest reading in 2014 so far. Nonetheless, the July score was revised up from 47.6.

Why Coca-Cola (KO) Stock Is Up Today,http://www.thestreet.com/story/12747046/1/why-coca-cola-ko-stock-is-up-today.html,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Coca Cola (KO) - Get Coca-Cola Company Report rose slightly on Tuesday after billionaire Warren Buffett denied money manager David Winters' speculation that the soda company could go private.

Buffett told CNBC quite simply that there is ""absolutely no chance of that"" happening. Winters, the founder and CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, has sent notices to Coca-Cola's shareholders and board as well as Buffett himself to criticize the company's 2014 equity plan. Winters believes this plan ""will significantly erode the per-share value of Coca-Cola shares.""

Coca-Cola rose in pre-market trading after Winters' remarks in an interview with Fox Business. The stock was up 0.22% to $40.75 at 10:07 a.m. following Buffett's comments.

In other news, Coca-Cola also partnered with 3D Systems (DDD) - Get 3D Systems Corporation Report and Black Eyed Peas front man will.i.am to create the Ekocycle Cube, a 3D printer that takes some of its materials from recycled plastic bottles.

Furthermore, Coca-Cola is an official partner of FIFA for the 2014 World Cup, which is underway in Brazil.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates COCA-COLA CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

""We rate COCA-COLA CO (KO) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations, reasonable valuation levels and notable return on equity. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.""

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The gross profit margin for COCA-COLA CO is rather high; currently it is at 65.87%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 15.30% is above that of the industry average.

Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 123.01% to $1,066.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, COCA-COLA CO has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -9.55%.

COCA-COLA CO's earnings per share declined by 7.7% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has suffered a declining pattern of earnings per share over the past year. However, we anticipate this trend reversing over the coming year. During the past fiscal year, COCA-COLA CO reported lower earnings of $1.90 versus $1.96 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.10 versus $1.90).

KO, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 2.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.2%. The declining revenue appears to have seeped down to the company's bottom line, decreasing earnings per share.

 China’s economy grew at its fastest pace since 2008 as consumer spending increased more quickly than inflation slowed down, according data released Tuesday showed. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth between 0% and 1%. However, economists cautioned it was premature to say whether this would translate into higher economic activity or lower unemployment rates later this year. “It will take time before we see any significant acceleration in GDP,"" said Liu Xiaoming, chief economist at Shanghai-based consultancy Daiwa Securities Group. ""But overall real wages are still very high."" Inflation has been falling steadily over recent years but remained below 2%, which some analysts have called unusually low given rising prices across Asia. A slowdown may also mean consumers won't spend much longer getting used with their food choices - something they did during last summer” when demand surged so dramatically from supermarkets.

Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing in Beijing that China`s ambassador to Malaysia met Malaysia`s foreign minister on Monday.

No trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and commercial navigation.

Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan, or a southern arc from Indonesia into the Indian Ocean west of Australia.

""Of course search and rescue efforts have become even harder now, and the area is much bigger,"" Hong said. ""We hope that Malaysia can provide more thorough, accurate information to countries participating.""

Hong declined to comment when asked if China is checking into the backgrounds of the Chinese passengers on board in search of suspicious histories. He declined to say whether China is searching over Tibet and the western region of Xinjiang for the jet, or whether China has ruled out that the plane entered its airspace.

About two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese.

Companies agree to ban 'microbeads',http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140619/news/140618287/,"Companies agree to ban 'microbeads'

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Environmentalists in Illinois expected a battle royal over their call for a statewide ban on ""microbeads"" -- tiny bits of plastic used in personal care products such as facial scrubs and toothpaste that are flowing by the billions into the Great Lakes and other waterways. Discovered only recently, scientists say they're showing up inside fish that are caught for human consumption.

But instead of resisting, leading companies quickly collaborated on a ban that was enacted by the state legislature this spring. And with similar measures now pending in at least three other large states, the extinction of microbeads is taking shape as one of the unlikeliest events in the politics of nature: a low-stress compromise by interest groups that are often at each other's throats.

""To have that happen in one year is rare,"" said Jen Walling of the Illinois Environmental Council, recalling the pessimistic response when she initially sought legislative sponsors. ""I was not predicting we'd get it done at all.""

Don't get used to it, said Mark Biel of the Chemical Industry Council of Illinois, which represented the product manufacturers during three months of negotiations. The quick deal resulted from unique circumstances, he said, including the availability of substitute ingredients.

""I just concluded that maybe this was one of those issues where it would be smart to try to work something out,"" he said.

Disagreements over details are delaying similar bills in California and New York, while a measure in Ohio has gained little traction. Still, all sides expect deals in most cases, and that given those states' outsized place in the market, microbeads will disappear from U.S. products as the industry swallows the cost.

Environmentalists hope the collaborative experience carries over to debates concerning the Great Lakes' other ills. Biel's group last year helped scuttle a proposal to restrict flame retardants, which some consider an emerging contaminant in the freshwater seas. Still, he says the microbead talks nurtured a better working relationship, as have negotiations over fending off invasive species like the Asian carp.

""There is room for common ground,"" he said.

It's been known for years that the world's oceans teem with masses of floating plastic. But microplastics in the Great Lakes were discovered only when scientists dragged the surface of all five lakes in 2012 and 2013 with specially designed nets and found the specks everywhere.

Barely visible without a microscope, the bits flow through wastewater treatment plant screens and into the lakes. Sherri Mason, an environmental scientist with State University of New York-Fredonia who was a leader of the research team, said the beads are showing up the stomachs of Great Lakes perch and in fish-eating birds like the double-crested cormorant. Her group is studying whether the particles are absorbing toxins in the lakes.

Because treated wastewater flows into so many waterways, Mason said, ""Every river and every inland lake you look at is going to have some plastic in it.""

The plastic exfoliants apparently came into widespread use in the 1990s, preferred because they are smoother to the skin than natural ingredients. Laurent Gilbert, director of advanced research at L'Oreal, said they have ""no proven environmental toxicity.""

Still, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate, Unilever and L'Oreal are among the companies announcing plans to replace microbeads with natural substances such as ground-up fruit pits, oatmeal and sea salt.

The industry has yet to endorse a California bill that wouldn't make an exception for biodegradable microbeads, which the industry says are on the drawing board. A ban has unanimously passed New York's state Assembly, but is awaiting Senate action while the industry pushes for a slower timetable. The measure would prohibit most cosmetics with microbeads by 2016. The Illinois phase-out is more gradual, running from 2017 to the end of 2019.

The companies say that it can take years to develop new mixtures and get them to market.

But with microbeads apparently on their way out, ban supporters say the lesson is that public pressure can pay off.

""People say, 'Wait, there's plastic in my face wash? In my toothpaste?""' said Mason, who teamed with the California-based organization 5 Gyres on the research. ""They understand innately that this isn't right and ... industry definitely responds. When we put our minds to something we can make it happen.""",0,723,Companies agree to ban," 'microbeads' TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Environmentalists in Illinois expected a battle royal over their call for a statewide ban on ""microbeads"" -- tiny bits of plastic used in personal care products such as facial scrubs and toothpaste that are flowing by the billions into the Great Lakes and other waterways.

"Europe's stocks, periphery's bonds dip as banks fined",http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/international/europes-stocks-peripherys-bonds-dip-as-banks-fined_103452.html,"London: Europe`s main stock indices and lower-rated government bonds slipped on Tuesday amid reports of new US fines for banks and dimming prospects the European Central Bank will launch an asset- purchase programme.

Wall Street was expected to start down 0.1 percent, as investors continued to hold off from making big bets going into a corporate earnings season that kicks off with Alcoa after markets close.

European equity indexes fell for a third consecutive day after reports that Germany`s largest lenders were negotiating a settlement with US authorities over their dealings with countries blacklisted by Washington. The talks follow a huge fine for French lender BNP Paribas.

""These fines add to an existing uncertainty in the banking sector,"" said Berenberg`s senior economist, Christian Schulz, pointing out that the balance sheets of the region`s banks are currently under review by the ECB.

At 0945 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.5 percent at 1,380.33. Germany`s Dax and France`s CAC were also down 0.5 percent, while weaker than expected UK factory output data dragged the FTSE 100 down 0.6 percent.

Shares in German lender Commerzbank fell 4 percent as the New York Times reported it could pay at least $500 million in penalties. Its larger competitor Deutsche Bank saw its shares slip 1.3 percent.

The ECB has made unprecedented policy moves in recent months to stimulate bank lending and revive the euro zone economy.

But late on Monday ECB Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger showed the strength of opposition in some quarters to a programme of asset purchases, which she said should be a last resort.

Many economists say such a programme, known as quantitative easing, might not prove as effective as it has in the United States because Europe relies on traditional forms of bank lending more than capital markets. ECB chief Mario Draghi has also said that might be the case.

Berenberg`s Schulz said he felt QE should only be used to fight a future sovereign debt crisis stemming from the bloc`s fragile states. It was these lower-rated sovereign bonds that struggled on Tuesday, with traders citing Lautenschlaeger`s speech.

Yields on 10-year Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and Irish bonds edged up between 1-7 basis points, although they remain near record lows.

In currency markets, the big mover was sterling, which fell against the dollar after an unexpected dip in British factory and industrial output, although strategists said the data was unlikely to curb the pound`s strength for long.

""Taken as a whole, the UK data still points at quite a resilient, robust recovery,"" said Valentin Marinov, a currency strategist at Citigroup.

The dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of other major currencies, just nudging into a sixth straight day of gains, as markets waited for minutes on Wednesday of the Federal Reserve`s last meeting, which will be scoured for hints on when its policy committee might consider raising interest rates.

Asia was quiet overnight, with the region`s stocks tracking sideways as the earnings season kicked off with disappointing guidance from regional tech heavyweight Samsung.

MSCI`s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, having earlier touched a three-year high of 502.27 during the session.

The US earnings season starts with Alcoa later on Tuesday and dozens of major companies are scheduled to report next week, including numerous Dow components.

Profits are forecast to grow 6.2 percent for the quarter, according Reuters data, but investors see a chance of a return to double-digit growth for the first time in nearly three years.

In commodity markets, gold reversed earlier losses, edging up to $1,323.45 an ounce, having held to a relatively tight $1,305.90 to $1,332.10 range for the past two weeks.

Oil prices extended their recent decline as events in Iraq and Ukraine have so far not led to any serious disruption in flows.

  The UESP Financial Times has identified a “highly credible” whistleblower as former HSBC banker Mark Carney who is leading an investigation into how Britain's central bank handled its massive data breach last year.

 (File photo) Former UK banking regulator and ex-HSBC chief executive Mark Clarke was named by senior officials of both institutions today following his testimony before parliament about their handling at the heighted financial crisis. He will be joined by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, head of regulatory affairs for Barclays, which runs Lloyds Banking Group, chairman of Standard Chartered and director general of compliance for Wells Fargo & Co.

In addition he joins David Cameron, MP for Winchester South West and shadow home secretary John Swinney from London Mayor Sadiq Khan - along with two other MPs including Yvette Cooper and Caroline Lucas – alongside others calling for greater transparency around what happened during the worst period of British finance history. This week we also heard evidence that some members of staff were under pressure over concerns they could face retaliation or worse when reporting problems related specifically not to banks but to regulators themselves. We are now awaiting confirmation whether Mr Clarke can return tomorrow morning so long as there is no further delay due to this latest development. His successor must then have confidence enough to ensure any action taken against him remains within proper procedure.""The allegations come amid mounting concern among politicians across the political spectrum regarding why authorities failed to act swiftly while failing badly,"" says Fitch Ratings analyst Andrew Tyrie ""It seems likely these revelations won't go unnoticed either way because many believe such things should never happen again"".Mr Clarke told reporters yesterday : ‘I think people need to know where I stand... There needs always to remain clarity out there between those responsible and victims...

Roche to Absorb Seragon Pharmaceuticals,http://www.thestreet.com/story/12763966/1/roche-to-absorb-seragon-pharmaceuticals.html,"NEW YORK (The Deal) -- European drugmakers continued to look across the Atlantic on Wednesday to expand their portfolios with Switzerland's Roche Holding agreeing to buy recently created San Diego biotech Seragon Pharmaceuticals for up to $1.73 billion and France's Nicox arranging to pay as much as $120 million for Boston's Aciex Therapeutics Inc.

Roche, through its Genentech division, would pay $725 million upfront for Seragon and as much as $1 billion in milestone payments should the target's experimental breast cancer treatment prove viable.

Seragon was spun out of Aragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. after Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy Aragon last fall for as much as $1 billion. It's developing a breast cancer treatment that could target rogue cells that alter the cells that absorb estrogen.

Roche says 60% of breast cancers are estrogen-related and are often fought by halting the hormone's uptake. Unfortunately, when treatment ends -- and hormone absorption resumes -- cancer often returns or worsens.

Seragon's treatment could help, but it's at the first of three trial phases. It could be five years or more until it's ready for the market.

Seragon was funded by Aragon's backers, including Column Group, OrbiMed Advisors, Aisling Capital, TopSpin and venBio.

Meanwhile, in France, Nicox agreed to pay $65 million in new shares for Aciex Therapeutics as well as the rights to an additional $55 million in shares should certain conditions be met.

Aciex is developing a number of treatments for such eye maladies as conjunctivitis, dryness and post-surgical swelling.

""The combination with Aciex would enable Nicox to expand its therapeutic pipeline to target major segments of the ophthalmic sector, including the $816 million U.S. allergic conjunctivitis market,"" Nicox CEO Michele Garufi said in a statement.

Aciex was founded in 2007 and is backed by Akorn Inc., Bay City Capital LLC, HealthCare Ventures LLC, New Enterprise Associates Inc. and Ora Investment Group.

In the Seragon deal, the target took counsel from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC.

In the Nicox acquisition of Aciex, MTS Securities LLC acted as financial adviser to Nicox with Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo PC as well as Clifford Chance LLP providing counsel.

  The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its next interest rate decision in just over two weeks, but it’s not likely to be announced until late June or early July and could take months if not longer than economists had forecast.

Most uninsured don't know Obamacare deadline,http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/26/news/economy/obamacare-uninsured/,"Americans have only a few days left to sign up on the Obamacare exchanges, yet most of the uninsured don't know the deadline.

Six in 10 uninsured adults are not aware that open enrollment ends March 31, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll released Wednesday. Half of the uninsured surveyed said they will remain without coverage this year.

The survey results show that the massive outreach campaign undertaken by the Obama administration and its allies have not penetrated through the ranks of the American public.

More than 40% of those polled said they didn't know that federal subsidies were available to help cover premiums. More than half were not aware that the law expanded Medicaid. The uninsured often cite cost as the top reason why they don't obtain coverage.

The survey results come as the Obama administration agreed to give some applicants more time to complete the process. Traffic to the federal exchange site and call center, which are handling enrollment in 36 states, are approaching record levels, officials said. Some 1.2 million people visited healthcare.gov on Tuesday, and more than 500,000 called the help line the first two days of this week.

Those who start the sign-up process before March 31 but become stymied by technical difficulties can finish picking a plan after the deadline. They must attest on the application that they could not complete the process by the deadline, but officials will not double-check that these folks are indeed eligible to pick their plans after March 31.

""We won't close the door of those who tried to get covered and were unable to do so through no fault of their own,"" said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. ""Those who were in line or had technical problems with the website can quickly come back and sign up as soon as possible.""

Bataille would not specify how much time consumers will receive to complete the process, saying only that it may take a few days or a week or so.

Officials provided similar leeway to those signing up in late December who wanted coverage to begin on Jan. 1. At that time, 20,000 people took advantage of the extended enrollment period.

Several states running their own exchanges, including Nevada and Minnesota, have also said they will allow applicants to pick plans after March 31 as long as they've started the process before the deadline.

Americans who have life changes, such as the loss of a job, during the year will be able to obtain coverage even after open enrollment closes.

Those who remain uninsured in 2014 face a penalty of $95 or 1% of income, whichever is greater.

"Yahoo posts anemic quarterly growth, turnaround chugs along",http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/yahoo-q1-growth-muted-marissa-mayer-turnaround-chugs-along/1/205197.html,"Yahoo Inc again posted anemic quarterly revenue growth as the Internet company's advertising business continues to lag its rivals, nearly two years into Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer's comeback effort.

Mayer told analysts on Tuesday that new mobile and advertising initiatives were gaining momentum, positioning the company for a period of stable but modest growth. Revenue from its core display advertising business inched 2 per cent higher in the first quarter, reversing several consecutive quarters of declines.

But the company forecast second-quarter revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion. That suggests revenue could decline by as much as 1 per cent or rise by up to 2.7 per cent from $1.07 billion a year earlier, underscoring the challenges facing its business.

That did not faze Wall Street, which is focused primarily on Yahoo's 24 per cent stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce giant that is expected to go public later this year.

Yahoo's shares climbed 7 per cent on strong results from Alibaba.

""It's really Alibaba driving things,"" said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter. Yahoo's core business improved slightly in the first quarter, but ""really the story here is Alibaba and the somewhat unexpected re-acceleration"" of its revenue growth.

The Chinese company's revenue increased 66 per cent to $3.06 billion in the fourth quarter, according to slides that Yahoo posted on its investor relations website on Tuesday, faster than the 51 per cent growth in Alibaba's third quarter.

Yahoo reports the Chinese company's financial results one quarter later than its own.



CHEAPER ADS PROLIFERATE

Mayer is trying to revitalize Yahoo's business. The former Google Inc executive revamped many of Yahoo's Web products but its ad sales business continues to struggle while rivals such as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc continue to post strong, double-digit revenue growth.

Revenue from display ads, which accounts for roughly 40 per cent of Yahoo's overall sales, increased just 2 per cent to $453 million, excluding partner fees. That meager growth follows several consecutive quarters of decline in the display ad business.

Yahoo said it was making progress in developing new mobile technology, online video, social media and new ad formats. The company now counts 430 million monthly users of its mobile products, while the number of online video streams consumers watched increased 30 per cent from the fourth quarter.

Finance chief Ken Goldman said that so-called ""stream ads"" that appear in-between scrolling news headlines on Yahoo's Web pages now account for about a fifth of the number of display ads that the company serves. He noted that stream ads were priced lower, weighing on the company's total average price per display ad, which declined 5 per cent.

Goldman did not provide any update on how Yahoo might use the proceeds from the Alibaba IPO, during which Yahoo is required to sell 40 per cent of its stake in the company.

Alibaba, valued at more than $140 billion, is expected to go public later this year in the United States in the largest IPO since Facebook's debut in 2012.

Yahoo's revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, came to $1.087 billion in the first quarter, up from $1.074 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected adjusted revenue of $1.077 billion.

It had net income of $311.6 million, or 29 cents a share, in the first quarter. It earned 38 cents a share excluding certain items.

Revenue from display ads, which accounts for roughly 40 per cent of Yahoo's overall sales, increased just 2 per cent to $453 million, excluding partner fees. That meager growth follows several consecutive quarters of decline in the display ad business. Yahoo said it was making progress in developing new mobile technology, online video, social media and new ad formats. The company now counts 430 million monthly users of its mobile products, while the number of online video streams consumers watched increased 30 per cent from the fourth quarter. Finance chief Ken Goldman said that so-called ""stream ads"" that appear in-between scrolling news headlines on Yahoo's Web pages now account for about a fifth of the number of display ads that the company serves. He noted that stream ads were priced lower, weighing on the company's total average price per display ad, which declined 5 per cent. Goldman did not provide any update on how Yahoo might use the proceeds from the Alibaba IPO, during which Yahoo is required to sell 40 per cent of its stake in the company. Alibaba, valued at more than $140 billion, is expected to go public later this year in the United States in the largest IPO since Facebook's debut in 2012. Yahoo's revenue, excluding fees paid to partner websites, came to $1.087 billion in the first quarter, up from $1.074 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected adjusted revenue of $1.077 billion. It had net income of $311.6 million, or 29 cents a share, in the first quarter. It earned 38 cents a share excluding certain items. (Reuters)"," its quarterly results on Wednesday, with the stock up 4.3 percent to $34.08 in after-hours trading.
