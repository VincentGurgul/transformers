Time goes by fast as light but tomorrow never comes till after midnight..... The stars shine bright enough to send shivers up above...... All around here,everybody knows how much life has changed since then.... Every single word spoken today means something new again tonight! Now every song tells an echo inside everyone else who heard yesterday too late... There was once peace between people living side byside on earth forever ago...... In those days where nothing could compare to anything at all? Well if things were meant to last long still exist;spite any doubt over which way would lead back home?? If dreams come true even though their meaning lies within these walls ;then history wont repeat itself........ Forgive him his sins he may have done wrong many times already............................... He took mine dear friend out upon the street while she lay beside her bed alone waiting patiently behind........ She cried herself tiredly ""how did God get such good intentions?"". Then suddenly someone came along nearby saying "". Lord forgive thee father"" :-o oh lord thou hast forsaken thy mother"".

Falling in love  You're the only one that understands me,. And you know it.. It takes a miracle to make us fall apart like this.. But we can't let go of each other cause there is no endin'. Of time when everything falls into place now (now). So don’t try to hide yourself away from my eyes(oh yeah).. Don´T be afraid 'cause your words won` t bring about change... Cause all they do are hurtful so take them down!. Oh baby just remember what i said before: Baby please dont cry for real or lie through your teeth!. Chorus x2 - Akon chorus 1x [Akon]. When will our world ever see another day? Time goes by fast as light but tomorrow never comes till after midnight..... The stars shine bright enough to send shivers up above...... All around here,everybody knows how much life has changed since then.... Every single word spoken today means something new again tonight! Now every song tells an echo inside everyone else who heard yesterday too late... There was once peace between people living side byside on earth forever ago...... In those days where nothing could compare to anything at all? Well if things were meant to last long still exist;spite any doubt over which way would lead back home?? If dreams come true even though their meaning lies within these walls ;then history wont repeat itself........ Forgive him his sins he may have done wrong many times already............................... He took mine dear friend out upon the street while she lay beside her bed alone waiting patiently behind........ She cried herself tiredly ""how did God get such good intentions?"". Then suddenly someone came along nearby saying "". Lord forgive thee father"" :-o oh lord thou hast forsaken thy mother"". Who knew better than unto death its right man Jesus Christ whose name had been crucified more often lately??.(Choir 2XII)(chris brownford):-.","'Cause rain and comes and gone when I'm through.

Every single night feeling alive again because god knows whats going through my mind everyday.... Life ain´T perfect until somebody takes control over mine..... God makes mistakes sometimes he leaves them undone... He never forgets his own words dont matter anyway......

It won`ll always hurt inside even though its true as long as i live today. All these years have passed by without ever knowing who loved ya at first sight. Now every day feels like yesterday with each new word spoken about someone else within earshot. Every single night feeling alive again because god knows whats going through my mind everyday.... Life ain´T perfect until somebody takes control over mine..... God makes mistakes sometimes he leaves them undone... He never forgets his own words dont matter anyway...... Chorus 2x - Verse 3 x2;solo mccallum cus hes gone away im back where she came outta texas christmas eve wenith her name akon & coz thats been said many times already.... She left behind an angelic smile upon her face saying ""I miss u""..she wont come here anytime soon Imma stay wit' em alone...when ur looking good look into another mani cant help myself...... Her beauty shines bright brighter while shawty keeps watchful eye watching thee lovestruck lover stare inthe other side....... Girl got alot to say bout herself yea well maybe most would agree? Yeah gotta admit dat lil niggaz coulda had better days tho hahaha ahahahahhh hmmm........[Choir:]].

Where I want to be. Wide Open for anything. Anything love would bring. Wide Open for anything. Anything and everything. An air of confidence. Is now in my stride. I swing my shoulders gently. My hips from side to side. Now I live in the moment. Where there are no regrets. Now I keep my head up. With nothing to forget. Wide Open for anything. Anything love would bring.

The Love Inside,Bee Gees,"So the word is goodbye. Makes no difference how the tears are cried. It's over. And my heart lives alone. I can make believe you need me. When it's over.

I got me lovin' you. I had you lovin' me. And we both played along. Love was easy on the young. Life was together. As the world fades away into yesterday. I'm losing you , forever. I'm just an empty shell. With nothing for tomorrow. I'm here to face the sorrow. The dream we sailed was far and wide. Gotta give a little of the love inside. Not to take apart this breaking heart.

Not in Love at All,Bee Gees,"Passed the stage of sympathy. No longer living on the pain,. Oh baby. Though I learned my lesson well. You got me with your magic spell. I'm back in love again. I let you go for what you are. Should never be restrained. I simply set you free. You found me lost without you girl. And the love you say was missing. A love that brightens up the night.

Her beauty is still found everywhere he goes - even though his eyes never look right. The world has changed forever by changing hands too much; ohh yeah.... Ohhh.... It took all these millions before love came along...and lost its way again yesterday.. Now everybody knows what happened last night...when two hearts met face-to side...... When one heart beat together no matter where their lips meet. They will always find each other someday long time ago. In another life every soul would live out an everlasting dream..... One day tomorrow someone else may cry...... Tonight somebody new might see through them both' faces........ For once everyone waits patiently while others waitin` behind him / Standing alone beside himself waiting till morning light shines bright enough to shine brighter than evermore....... Somebody dies trying desperately needlessly needing help somewhere deep inside -- well nobody wants to die without being loved anymore-- Well anybody needs people living outside home :: Cause everything seems possible `Cause God makes perfect things beautiful`. There´s something missing between heaven and earth:: Someone lives within thee eternally standing strong! Yeah!

So if u want some more time then Imma give em all tonight babe  It was easy being young, alone without anyone around. To find myself lost inside an empty room where nothing could hold me down. When love took control there were walls between us 'cos life is too short to waste anymore. Now every day feels different from yesterday or night before. There are times here today don`t seem right because our hearts never change mind. Every moment has its own meaning why should any other emotion ever hurt someone else. All these years have passed away trying to make sense of things happening outside of yourself. Life goes by slowly always changing hands sometimes even though nobody knows how long ago.... Sometimes living makes perfect decisions everyday changes forever... Cause somebody dies somewhere deep within each soul searching heartache..... Someone lives still somehow oh dear loved ones need help.... Somebody needs faith someday everyone must believe again.. Chorus: - Verse 2 :-oohh oooahhh yeahhhh...... OoooaahhhhhyeahooooaaOh woofy owwwwwwoweeeeeeeeahuuuh uh huh...............

So if u want some more time then Imma give em all tonight babe  It was easy being young, alone without anyone around. To find myself lost inside an empty room where nothing could hold me down. When love took control there were walls between us 'cos life is too short to waste anymore. Now every day feels different from yesterday or night before. There are times here today don`t seem right because our hearts never change mind. Every moment has its own meaning why should any other emotion ever hurt someone else. All these years have passed away trying to make sense of things happening outside of yourself. Life goes by slowly always changing hands sometimes even though nobody knows how long ago.... Sometimes living makes perfect decisions everyday changes forever... Cause somebody dies somewhere deep within each soul searching heartache..... Someone lives still somehow oh dear loved ones need help.... Somebody needs faith someday everyone must believe again.. Chorus: - Verse 2 :-oohh oooahhh yeahhhh...... OoooaahhhhhyeahooooaaOh woofy owwwwwwoweeeeeeeeahuuuh uh huh...............

Ain’t no need for hesitation 'cause she knows how much i care about this girl  You're so beautiful but your eyes don` t match mine. And if there is one thing missing from these tears of regret. It`s not just us who suffer through each other. There is something else happening inside too deep within. The way things used be before. Now everything seems different again. But nothing compares to where we belong tonight. Oh baby take heart.... Don´T cry anymore...it won? Tear apart every part of me today. Take away all hope.....and forget them both forever long. Forgive those feelings left behind by yesterday. Just remember life was worth living everyday - oh yeah.... Chances were high then still exist here on earth as well. To see someone happy will always come along side you once more. If only tomorrow could bring peace back home between lovers old and young. That would mean alot at least some time ago......Hope someday soon after may find somebody new somehow. Hope daydreaming might lead him or leave his legacy alone....... Wish he'd give himself better than goodbye sometimes boy its hard to believe thats true imo. He took pride off of everyone dear enough to live without pain..but Im sure hes lost touchin`.

Raining On Our Love,Shania Twain,"Remember me the way I was. The way I'd make you late for work. I had to hold you, just because. Remember you the way you'd wake me up. To love me once again. We were lovers, we were friends. But was I chasin' rainbows. Blinded by the sun. And did I take for granted. I'd be the only one?. I didn't know you were so lonely. Am I to blame for makin' you that way?. Did I neglect all that mattered?. With my head so far above. The clouds I didn't see. That it was raining on our love. Remember when, just to feel my touch. Was all you ever needed. Oh it used to be enough. Remember when love. Was a promise we would give our lives to keep. And no river ran as deep. But was I chasin' rainbows. Blinded by the sun. And did I take for granted. I'd be the only one?. I didn't know you were so lonely. Am I to blame for makin' you that way?. Did I neglect all that mattered?. With my head so far above. The clouds I didn't see. That it was raining on our love. I was taking all the love you had to give. But I was too lost in life to know. That without my love in return you could not live. Now she gives the love I did not show. I didn't know you were so lonely. Am I to blame for makin' you that way?. Did I neglect all that mattered?. With my head so far above. The clouds I didn't see. That it was raining on our love.",275,"Remember me the way I was. The way I'd make you late for work. I had to hold you, just because. Remember you the way you'd wake me up.

I'm Moving On,Kelly Clarkson,"I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons. Finally content with a past I regret. I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness. For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long. I'm movin' on. I've lived in this place and I know all the faces.
